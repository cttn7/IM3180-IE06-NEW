lle8zq5,,Holy_Beergut,"There used to be an outlet in Thomson Plaza. I think their large pepperoni pizza was like $8 iirc and I could eat it for 2 meals, so was quite value for money.

I did my part and ate it fairly regularly but they eventually shut down, was sad to see it go.",385
lleh974,lle8zq5,LORD-SOTH-,"I also used to patronise the outlet at Thomson Plaza regularly .

Much cheaper than the overpriced Pizza Hut restaurant, which BTW also recently closed down ( together with KFC), in Thomson Plaza.

I am not surprised that Ceasars Pizza collapsed.
The outlet at Ang Mo Kio started rejecting credit card payments a couple of months ago, on the flimsy excuse that their credit card machines were not working , and accepted cash only.

It was just a BS excuse to reduce their financial costs.

Bottom line is they became desperate as a business entity and tried all sorts of ways to reduce costs . 
The signs of impending doom were all there .",172
llek5l1,lleh974,Holy_Beergut,"Yeah, I live within 10 mins walking distance of Thomson plaza, so go there regularly. As you said, up until it closed down, Pizza Hut was the only other pizza place in Thomson plaza to get my pizza fix if needed. 

There is also another pizza place, not in Thomson plaza but nearby, but they're more expensive, and the type of pizza they have is thin crust so I'm not a fan.

On another note, and just a small rant. After Pizza Hut and KFC closed down at Thomson Plaza. I was wondering what eatery would open up to take its place. Turns out, it was Sushiro. 

I was definitely not expecting it to be another japanese restaurant, considering that Thomson Plaza is already over-saturated with japanese restaurants in my opinion (Before Sushiro opened last month, there were already 6-7 other Japanese F&Bs in operation)

I guess can't blame the Thomson Plaza management too much as they probably only care about getting a new tenant asap. But I wonder what was in Sushiro's mind when they decided to open an outlet in Thomson Plaza, assuming they did their market research and knew how many other japanese restaurants already existed there.",67
lleqctb,llek5l1,yapyd,"When there are 6-7 Japanese restaurants and they are surviving or even possibly thriving, that generally means there's a big enough demand in the area for it. If sushiro is able to beat out the other restaurants, they would monopolise the market for themselves. ",55

llf6fxp,llek5l1,AdUnfair7713,"Well I mean if you've walked into the pizza hut branch at Thomson plaza, you would notice that it was always empty. It did take tons of delivery orders but that volume must not have been enough to keep it going. Compare that with Sushiro. It opened a while ago only but it already has queues at lunchtime and dinner time. I guess the demand for Japanese food in the area is just much higher than that for pizza. I love Japanese food, but also at the same time a bit sian that there's so many Japanese restaurants at Thomson Plaza haha

lle809f,,skatyboy,"As for those wondering why “cheap still cannot attract enough business”, pizza isn’t really a staple here, unlike in Western countries (especially US). 

Hence, the volume isn’t going to be enough as compared to the US, where even in low density suburbs, high rents and $20/hr minimum wage, it’s still turning a profit and there’s multiple cheap pizza places for like 200k population. Where I stay in the US, I can count like 20 pizza shops in a radius of 3km and the population in that “radius” isn’t even 100k (low density suburbia).

A lot of people in the US eat pizza like we eat hawker food.",461
lle8k2x,lle809f,Toyboyronnie,There's pizza hut and dominors everywhere. Canadian pizza. Spizza or whatever.  I think it's more a lack of marketing and lack of halal.,140

llebdyw,lle8k2x,skatyboy,"Those are expensive so they can profit with less sales. Doubling the price with same expenses (not like the other chains use higher quality ingredients for their pizzas) means you can sell half to break even. Think 100 vs 50 pies a month. Think 5% market share to profit vs 10%.

If you look at hawkers you do see a lot of non-halal hawkers that are still making bank, despite the ridiculous rents (especially for popular centers), so I don’t think it is a big factor if price was actually the way to gain a profitable share in the market.

Also the level of pizza obsession isn’t crazy in SG, yes, a lot of outlets, but not like 1 store for every 5k people.",56
llecu5s,llebdyw,RIMBarisax,"I feel like it’s a bit different for pizza because pizza tends to be food for big group events or activities where the demand for halal food is going to be stronger, vs hawkers where you’re either on your own or in small groups or if you have Muslim people there, they can buy from other stalls",38
lled961,llecu5s,skatyboy,"That’s the problem, in the US, it’s not “big group event food”, it’s literally lunch for a group of people working. It’s lunch for after school practice.

There’s more sales overall per capita, compared to SG where the average weekday isn’t pizza for lunch.

It might have been a factor but overall, I don’t think the volumes would support that price point in the first place.

There are also non-halal “group food”, like hotpot (e.g. HDL) or zichar, that are making bank in SG despite the lack of halal certification. Pizza in the States is like HDL/zichar for us, group food but not only catering/event kind of food.

Conversely, even in Malaysia (where halal is a large factor and cuisines are almost similar), their pizzas are also expensive relative to wages there.

Makes me think it’s just incompatible cuisines + higher overhead (e.g. cheese is expensive), like selling spicy food in a country where people don’t eat spicy food often and spices are expensive.",47
llemcqr,lled961,Mochiron_samurai,"making bank in SG despite the lack of halal certification

llejz04,lled961,JLtheking,"Pretty much. In the US you can grab a slice of pizza for like $3 at your local deli and that would just be your lunch. It’s basically their fast food cheap cai png that everyone eats by default. A “healthier” option like a sandwich goes for far more. 

Singaporeans just don’t buy pizza by the slice as a matter of habit (and places that do sell it very expensive), so that actually cuts a lot out of a pizza place’s profit margins.",13
llf6aff,llejz04,Fakerchan,"Hmm depends , dominos sell reg pizza at 5$ tho",-2
llf7059,llf6aff,JLtheking,"Yeah but it’s not fast food. You can’t just walk up to a counter, pick it up and leave. You gotta order in advance or sit down and wait and this is not really compatible with the kind of fast paced lunch culture we have here in sg. 

So as a result pizza is treated similarly to eating at a restaurant kind of affair. Only for special occasions instead of a staple food like cai png or McDonald’s.

When was the last time you as an individual ordered that $5 pizza just for yourself?",6

llgyhmg,lleik1d,haruharu1,"Being halal is not the issue with it, it’s how they substitute flavours that are commonly done with pork. Their Salamis and pepperoni is always beef. The meat heavy pizzas also are very beef heavy, which normally isnt a meat used much in pizzas. Don’t think any fast food has cracked that yet. Kinda sucks coz us non beef eaters end up having only tomato/veggie/bbq chicken as pizza options.

They are, however, significantly cheaper and good enough for those who are okay with the occasional binge session.

I'm just sad that cheese, like all imported ingredients, is marked up in cost which makes it harder for any f&b product w/ cheese to stay competitive relative to stuff w/o cheese.

We would sell a pizza list price for like USD18 and always had a 1 for 1 or specific special going on ( e.g., 2 large 2 toppings for USD19.99).  The shops costs were tracked by a system which measured inventory and active labor.  An XL pizza only cost around USD1.60 to USD2.00 to make inclusive of labour.  My chain's cost were the highest since they used a more expensive cheese than dominos or pizza hut.   
   
Little Caesars is cheaper because of its streamlined menu. They push the hot and ready cheese/pepperoni really hard which they sell for like USD8.00.  you can generally walk into an outlet and grab either pizza instantly.  The premium pizzas go up to USD15.00.  it makes a profit on everything it sells in the US and it probably did here.  Rent is likely the killer and lower customer base because it's not halal.",1

Much cheaper than the overpriced Pizza Hut restaurant, which BTW also recently closed down ( together with KFC), in Thomson Plaza.

I am not surprised that Ceasars Pizza collapsed.
The outlet at Ang Mo Kio started rejecting credit card payments a couple of months ago, on the flimsy excuse that their credit card machines were not working , and accepted cash only.

It was just a BS excuse to reduce their financial costs.

Bottom line is they became desperate as a business entity and tried all sorts of ways to reduce costs .

There is also another pizza place, not in Thomson plaza but nearby, but they're more expensive, and the type of pizza they have is thin crust so I'm not a fan.

On another note, and just a small rant. After Pizza Hut and KFC closed down at Thomson Plaza. I was wondering what eatery would open up to take its place. Turns out, it was Sushiro. 

I was definitely not expecting it to be another japanese restaurant, considering that Thomson Plaza is already over-saturated with japanese restaurants in my opinion (Before Sushiro opened last month, there were already 6-7 other Japanese F&Bs in operation)

I guess can't blame the Thomson Plaza management too much as they probably only care about getting a new tenant asap.

Think 5% market share to profit vs 10%.

If you look at hawkers you do see a lot of non-halal hawkers that are still making bank, despite the ridiculous rents (especially for popular centers), so I don’t think it is a big factor if price was actually the way to gain a profitable share in the market.

lled961,llecu5s,skatyboy,"That’s the problem, in the US, it’s not “big group event food”, it’s literally lunch for a group of people working. It’s lunch for after school practice.

There’s more sales overall per capita, compared to SG where the average weekday isn’t pizza for lunch.

It might have been a factor but overall, I don’t think the volumes would support that price point in the first place.

There are also non-halal “group food”, like hotpot (e.g. HDL) or zichar, that are making bank in SG despite the lack of halal certification. Pizza in the States is like HDL/zichar for us, group food but not only catering/event kind of food.

Conversely, even in Malaysia (where halal is a large factor and cuisines are almost similar), their pizzas are also expensive relative to wages there.

Makes me think it’s just incompatible cuisines + higher overhead (e.g. cheese is expensive), like selling spicy food in a country where people don’t eat spicy food often and spices are expensive.",47

lljv6rf,,Toyboyronnie,"Pizza is generally pretty cheap to make. I worked in a pizza place as teenage back in the early 2000s.  We would sell a pizza list price for like USD18 and always had a 1 for 1 or specific special going on ( e.g., 2 large 2 toppings for USD19.99).  The shops costs were tracked by a system which measured inventory and active labor.  An XL pizza only cost around USD1.60 to USD2.00 to make inclusive of labour.  My chain's cost were the highest since they used a more expensive cheese than dominos or pizza hut.   
   
Little Caesars is cheaper because of its streamlined menu. They push the hot and ready cheese/pepperoni really hard which they sell for like USD8.00.  you can generally walk into an outlet and grab either pizza instantly.  The premium pizzas go up to USD15.00.  it makes a profit on everything it sells in the US and it probably did here.  Rent is likely the killer and lower customer base because it's not halal.",1

There is also another pizza place, not in Thomson plaza but nearby, but they're more expensive, and the type of pizza they have is thin crust so I'm not a fan.

On another note, and just a small rant. After Pizza Hut and KFC closed down at Thomson Plaza. I was wondering what eatery would open up to take its place. Turns out, it was Sushiro. 

I was definitely not expecting it to be another japanese restaurant, considering that Thomson Plaza is already over-saturated with japanese restaurants in my opinion (Before Sushiro opened last month, there were already 6-7 other Japanese F&Bs in operation)

I guess can't blame the Thomson Plaza management too much as they probably only care about getting a new tenant asap.

If you look at hawkers you do see a lot of non-halal hawkers that are still making bank, despite the ridiculous rents (especially for popular centers), so I don’t think it is a big factor if price was actually the way to gain a profitable share in the market.

Also the level of pizza obsession isn’t crazy in SG, yes, a lot of outlets, but not like 1 store for every 5k people.",56

lled961,llecu5s,skatyboy,"That’s the problem, in the US, it’s not “big group event food”, it’s literally lunch for a group of people working. It’s lunch for after school practice.

There’s more sales overall per capita, compared to SG where the average weekday isn’t pizza for lunch.

It might have been a factor but overall, I don’t think the volumes would support that price point in the first place.

There are also non-halal “group food”, like hotpot (e.g. HDL) or zichar, that are making bank in SG despite the lack of halal certification. Pizza in the States is like HDL/zichar for us, group food but not only catering/event kind of food.

Conversely, even in Malaysia (where halal is a large factor and cuisines are almost similar), their pizzas are also expensive relative to wages there.

Makes me think it’s just incompatible cuisines + higher overhead (e.g. cheese is expensive), like selling spicy food in a country where people don’t eat spicy food often and spices are expensive.",47

Singaporeans just don’t buy pizza by the slice as a matter of habit (and places that do sell it very expensive), so that actually cuts a lot out of a pizza place’s profit margins.",13

It opened a while ago only but it already has queues at lunchtime and dinner time. I guess the demand for Japanese food in the area is just much higher than that for pizza.

lled961,llecu5s,skatyboy,"That’s the problem, in the US, it’s not “big group event food”, it’s literally lunch for a group of people working. It’s lunch for after school practice.

It might have been a factor but overall, I don’t think the volumes would support that price point in the first place.

There are also non-halal “group food”, like hotpot (e.g. HDL) or zichar, that are making bank in SG despite the lack of halal certification. Pizza in the States is like HDL/zichar for us, group food but not only catering/event kind of food.

Conversely, even in Malaysia (where halal is a large factor and cuisines are almost similar), their pizzas are also expensive relative to wages there.
