lm1mkxg,lm1h819,ELfit4life,"***Actually***, if you want to look at it from a purely technical standpoint, it IS. 

“Esthetic” is noted and accepted only as a US variation spelling of the word, which was popularized by one of Webster’s spelling reforms—and it should be noted that it isn’t even the most used version of the spelling of the word (even in America). If we look at its etymology, the word originally combined the German “āsthetisch” (mid-18c.) or French “esthétique” (formed from the German) with the Greek “aisthetikos”, thus forming the *”ae”* diphthong that begins the proper spelling of the word: *aesthetic*. 

And finally, when pronouncing said initial gliding vowel sound that begins the word, it necessitates the tongue and other parts of the speech apparatus moving through two targets to form the sound—the very definition of a *diphthong*—and so remains the TRUE **proper** form of the word.

I speak the Queen’s, thank you. 🫡

And for those who didn't know, he was a hardcore democrat up until semi-recently - as in within the last 3-4 years -  so to call him a republican is fair game now but, historically speaking he's always been a democrat. He converted and switched sides and went full force republican the last few years. 

Whatever tf he named his kid, while insanely weird and stupid, it's also not a pronoun. It's a literal noun.

lm1p315,lm1c2ik,Smelly_Jockrash,"Yes, it means the appearance of something. Duh.

But, how is the aesthetic of what he named his child have anything to do with those who use pronouns? Nothing. He doesn't agree with those who use pronouns, which is perfectly fine but, in regards to that screenshot and what was said, I'm still not sure how that was a ""got em"" post because again, she is comparing an un-aesthetically pleasing name to those who use pronouns which are, he/him/she/her/his/etc etc etc... Which are also very un aesthetic but, that was hypocritical for him, so I'll give you that. But, would you disagree that any name can be un-aesthetic though and a name in general can be pretty or ugly dependent on each individual?

Ok sure, he named his child an incredibly unesthetic name and then goes on to say he doesn't agree with the pronouns that are not esthetic so yeah, that's hypocritical but I'd hardly consider him an asshole though. He's a weirdo for sure but, most weirdo's are assholes anyways but IMO, he seems pretty down to earth compared to most billionaires, actually.

He's an asshole to you because he is outspoken, speaks his mind freely, says what he wants, doesn't gaf what anyone thinks, bought Twitter, renamed it and has control over it, meaning he isn't censoring shit the living hell out of it like the last owner/CEO, and is no longer part of the democratic party; and that is destroying liberals now. The biggest information platform on earth is now controlled by a... republican.

Before he bought Twitter, he was just Elon... after he bought it he was suddenly turned into the ""bad guy"" and for literally no reason.

Elon, the richest man in the world who was a life long democrat is now a republican. NOW he's an asshole? Was he one before? Or is he an asshole because he isn't a liberal anymore?

You say he is a doofus, which he really is but, I'm 100% positive none of us are anywhere close to as rich as he is, nor as smart, nor as powerful so he may be a doofus but, he's still lightyears above the rest of us in brains, power, and money... So if he's a doofus, I'd love to be one too.

Though I'm curious why you think he is an asshole?

Because he is rich?

Because he is smart and successful?

Because he speaks his mind and doesn't give a shit what anyone else thinks?

Because he was a life long democrat who switched parties?

Or because his opinions, and views don't align with your own opinions or viewpoints.

Elon is a strange dude but he's not an asshole by any means. The only people who think he is are those who disagree with him on anything and everything he says for no real reason other than they hate the fact that he's no longer a democrat. Otherwise, he's just a smart, rich af, weird mother fucker. Kinda like any other rich as fuck person.
