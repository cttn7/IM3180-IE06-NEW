If we look at its etymology, the word originally combined the German ‚ÄúƒÅsthetisch‚Äù (mid-18c.) or French ‚Äúesth√©tique‚Äù (formed from the German) with the Greek ‚Äúaisthetikos‚Äù, thus forming the *‚Äùae‚Äù* diphthong that begins the proper spelling of the word: *aesthetic*. 

And finally, when pronouncing said initial gliding vowel sound that begins the word, it necessitates the tongue and other parts of the speech apparatus moving through two targets to form the sound‚Äîthe very definition of a *diphthong*‚Äîand so remains the TRUE **proper** form of the word.

Elon is weird af, quirky as hell and, I genuinely believe he is on the ""spectrum"" but he's also insanely smart, and smarter, richer and more successful than anyone here will ever be. I personally think he's kinda funny because he just doesn't gaf at all but, he's a weird ass dude for sure lol. 

And for those who didn't know, he was a hardcore democrat up until semi-recently - as in within the last 3-4 years -  so to call him a republican is fair game now but, historically speaking he's always been a democrat. He converted and switched sides and went full force republican the last few years. 

Whatever tf he named his kid, while insanely weird and stupid, it's also not a pronoun. It's a literal noun. We all know exactly what kind of pronouns he is referring to, and this hxlden twitter/X user is a fucking idiot who has clearly never taken a basic English class. She didn't ""get him good"" at all because, if she has then she'd know the difference between a noun and a pronoun.

That name is weird af but it is still a name...

I'm not getting what that person is trying to get at here because, she's basically trying to say that because Elon named his kid a weird ass name that is ugly as hell and nobody knows how to actually say it, that it somehow relates to pronouns?

So he says he has nothing against trans folks but like, I'm not sure how tf a fucked up NAME has anything to do with trans or pronouns?",-4,0,lm1bpoc,129,lm1bg0p,125
MilkeeBongRips,"Well you are correct that you aren‚Äôt getting it.

Do you know what ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù means? Start there.

**Aesthetic**-Concerned with beauty or the appreciation of beauty.

He is saying the added pronouns are ugly to read and say. You see where I‚Äôm going with this? He says pronouns aren‚Äôt beautiful to look at, while naming his child *that*?

He‚Äôs an asshole, man.",5,0,lm1c2ik,130,lm1bpoc,129
Smelly_Jockrash,"Yes, it means the appearance of something. Duh.

But, how is the aesthetic of what he named his child have anything to do with those who use pronouns? Nothing. He doesn't agree with those who use pronouns, which is perfectly fine but, in regards to that screenshot and what was said, I'm still not sure how that was a ""got em"" post because again, she is comparing an un-aesthetically pleasing name to those who use pronouns which are, he/him/she/her/his/etc etc etc... Which are also very un aesthetic but, that was hypocritical for him, so I'll give you that. But, would you disagree that any name can be un-aesthetic though and a name in general can be pretty or ugly dependent on each individual?

Ok sure, he named his child an incredibly unesthetic name and then goes on to say he doesn't agree with the pronouns that are not esthetic so yeah, that's hypocritical but I'd hardly consider him an asshole though. He's a weirdo for sure but, most weirdo's are assholes anyways but IMO, he seems pretty down to earth compared to most billionaires, actually.

He's an asshole to you because he is outspoken, speaks his mind freely, says what he wants, doesn't gaf what anyone thinks, bought Twitter, renamed it and has control over it, meaning he isn't censoring shit the living hell out of it like the last owner/CEO, and is no longer part of the democratic party; and that is destroying liberals now. The biggest information platform on earth is now controlled by a... republican.

Before he bought Twitter, he was just Elon... after he bought it he was suddenly turned into the ""bad guy"" and for literally no reason.

Elon, the richest man in the world who was a life long democrat is now a republican. NOW he's an asshole? Was he one before? Or is he an asshole because he isn't a liberal anymore?

You say he is a doofus, which he really is but, I'm 100% positive none of us are anywhere close to as rich as he is, nor as smart, nor as powerful so he may be a doofus but, he's still lightyears above the rest of us in brains, power, and money... So if he's a doofus, I'd love to be one too.

Though I'm curious why you think he is an asshole?

Because he is rich?

Because he is smart and successful?

Because he speaks his mind and doesn't give a shit what anyone else thinks?

Because he was a life long democrat who switched parties?

Or because his opinions, and views don't align with your own opinions or viewpoints.

Elon is a strange dude but he's not an asshole by any means. The only people who think he is are those who disagree with him on anything and everything he says for no real reason other than they hate the fact that he's no longer a democrat. Otherwise, he's just a smart, rich af, weird mother fucker. Kinda like any other rich as fuck person.

And for the record, my responses are just trying to counter yours. We clearly have different opinions and views but I enjoy civil debates and I respect your opinions because an opinion is a personal belief. Mine are mine and even if they don't align, that's perfectly ok.",-1,0,lm1p315,131,lm1c2ik,130
