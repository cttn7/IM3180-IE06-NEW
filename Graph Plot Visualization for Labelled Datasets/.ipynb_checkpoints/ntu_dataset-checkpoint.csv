Expecting to be recognized as superior 
 
Being preoccupied with fantasies of success, power, beauty, and idealization

There was no primary in 2021 that Kamala was a part of. She was vice president in 2021. 

>> two assassination attempts on Trump

That have been condemned by democrats

>> hi-ranking FBI agents worked to defeat Trump

First of all, high*-ranking. 

Second, this didn’t happen. What you might be thinking of is James Comey announcing reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails less than two weeks before the 2016 election, which undeniably had an impact of some degree on voters.

Here's the thing however. He never shares his supposed somehow always secret plans which are almost certainly imaginary and non existent, the rare times where he does it's an absolute joke that shows he has no clue what he's talking about and it doesn't even qualify as a plan, and either way, he somehow manages to get no results lmao. At best he gives some shitty childish excuse for why his plan didn't work, which is never his fault.

His plans to save people's jobs? Those people lost their jobs. His plans to make Mexico pay for the wall? Mexico didn't pay for the wall. His secret plans to end the War in Afghanistan within days of becoming president? The war kept going, and when asked later on, he said his plan was too cruel and he was too kind lmao. His secret plan now to end the war in Ukraine? Nobody knows, everybody guesses it's just submitting to Putin, but i'm gonna bet his so very secret plan which he somehow absolutely can't reveal until he hets elected for some very mysterious reason is not gonna happen either.

lonuxph,lonuo93,Zoktuy,"The cost of living crisis is caused by corporate greed, not a magic lever in the oval office.  

If you think Trump and Republicans are going to do anything to reduce the funneling from money from the working class into the pockets of big business then pass the fucking blunt.       

Again, Trump being elected wouldn't magically improve your life.   

Get a grip.",5,0,2
loo1dad,lonuxph,billydrivesavic,"And again Kamala has technically been in office the entire time life has sucked.  

So her being elected won’t magically improve shit either.  

The whole thing fucking sucks and I hate it.

also, get a grip? 

The only people I know that doesn’t have a grip are the ones that don’t remember how fucking easy it was to live 2016-2021

I know so many people that are like “I’ve never voted before but I’m voting this year”

2020 you know which side someone landed on when they are like “go vote! 😭 it’s so important to go vote omg”

Now it’s the opposite.",1,0,2
looaqse,loo1dad,Zoktuy,"You have to be a special kind of person to think Trump will magically make everything affordable for you.  

How will he do it?   
You don't know and you don't care.   

Meanwhile Harris has a plan to cap grocery price increases, the GOP calls it communism.      

You're embarrassing yourself by correlating ""Trump in office"" with ""I could afford shit"" when the reason you can't afford anything today is because corporate greed during the pandemic jacked the price of EVERYTHING up.  

For suck sake, look at the profits of every major business over the last 4 years and see they have increased exponentially while wages stagnated.   

Corporate greed is why cost of living is so bad.  

For the last time, get a fucking grip.",1,0,2
loobnzc,looaqse,billydrivesavic,"Funny enough the left were the ones that so badly wanted the planet to shut down cuz of the flu which is what fucked everything up.  Trump was out of office 2020. Height of the pandemic was 2021. HM

Why hasn’t Biden and Harris capped the grocery prices four years ago? 

Again again the left is like stay home save a life. Billionaires suck rarara but also pay Amazon more and more. 

Real strange how billionaires doubled their net worth during the pandemic while the rest of us have been suffering but OMG ROE V WADE

you look at your receipts for the last 10 years look at what was affordable and then tell yourself to get a grip 

I made my mind up when I went to buy a pack of cheese and a pack of ham and I was asked to bounty up $17 about it.


The amount of family owned businesses that had to close cuz of the fuck ass pandemic is depressing. Meanwhile big chains thrived.  


Politicians were constantly caught not following their own fucking rules about it.  

Everything was cool years ago. Everything sucks now.  I’m not embarrassing myself saying that 

I vividly remember paying $1.89 a gallon in 2018.  And for the last four years gas has been floating around $4 except oh wait that’s wild it’s under $3 right before elections.   Thanks Kamala! I should vote for you again",1,0,2
looc40p,loobnzc,Zoktuy,"Clowns like you are the reason the first lesson in Grade 9 science class is ""Correlation ≠ causation"".    

Because your entire reasoning is ""Trump was president and I could afford shit, therefore Trump is the reason I could afford shit!"" 🥴🥴🥴

How did Trump make everything affordable?  
You don't know.   

How will Trump make everything affordable again?

loodv1k,looc40p,billydrivesavic,"I’ll rebuttal with why was life affordable from 2016-2021

Why hasn’t life been affordable since then til now?
 
What will Kamala do different that Biden did?


There is no answer.  I don’t give a fuck if Trump is elected I just know if the same stupid cunt that’s already in office stays in office I’m going to have to sell my house in a year or be homeless 


Also is funny when Obama was in office gas was up near $4. What the fuck? I kinda get the president has fuck all to do with that but it’s awfully coincidental huh? 

Whoever makes life affordable again gets my vote. I’m not an embarrassment  for that

And again I don’t know anyone that has had to pay bills for the last 4 years that want another 4 years of this bullshit

Harris won’t answer any questions about her policies besides trying to implement similar things California has done and tried. California is doing so well /s all she does goes into rambling about her so called middle class growing up which is proven BS she went to private school. She faked her accent when she goes to a white, black and Hispanic rallies. Give trump all the shit at least he doesn’t hide is ego like other politicians. At least when he was office gas and groceries were affordable. It was the left that shutdown our country when he tried to keep it open. Biden and Harris has allowed this border crisis to swell so badly. Now we have South American gangs roaming cities. American citizens are getting booted for these illegals. There is that one city they cut the school buses but only to American children forcing parents to drive them or make them walk.  I get it trump runs his stupid mouth at least most of his policies didn’t hurt us Americans. The left caused our inflation crisis. The home buying issue no president can do anything about that. States though can cut the red tape to allow easier building that’s why CA and many other state that require high permits to build is why those states can’t build houses hence houses more expensive.",-3,0,2
loohobq,looe4df,draiki13,"I think Trump is much more responsive to the public and willing to actually do whatever he rambles on about. As long as it makes him popular. Obviously that means he does big promises that he can’t deliver on.

On the other hand typical politicians tread much more safely, make small promises and don’t even try to deliver on those.
