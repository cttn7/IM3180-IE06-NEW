He comes out and runs his mouth, shooting from the hip on literally everything, regardless of how well versed he is or is not on the topic.

Here's the thing however. He never shares his supposed somehow always secret plans which are almost certainly imaginary and non existent, the rare times where he does it's an absolute joke that shows he has no clue what he's talking about and it doesn't even qualify as a plan, and either way, he somehow manages to get no results lmao. At best he gives some shitty childish excuse for why his plan didn't work, which is never his fault.

His plans to save people's jobs? Those people lost their jobs. His plans to make Mexico pay for the wall? Mexico didn't pay for the wall. His secret plans to end the War in Afghanistan within days of becoming president? The war kept going, and when asked later on, he said his plan was too cruel and he was too kind lmao. His secret plan now to end the war in Ukraine?

When it became clear he couldn't handle another 4 years, Democrats applied pressure to get him to step aside. And he did a remarkable thing. He put the needs of the country over his own ego and threw his support behind Kamala. The GOP could have done that too. But they didn't. And Trump would never put the needs of the country over his own.
