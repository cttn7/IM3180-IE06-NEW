They started on patriotism, wound up on abortion, and addressed no major points anywhere in between. All the while the woman burned most of the time by effectively saying a string of words that really had no coherence as any kind of singular thought.

Every thing she mentioned was its own entire concept and should have been discussed separately.

So, there obviously is no moderation, which there should have been to shut down the “I’m gonna talk over you so everyone knows I’m right” bullsh*#.

Beyond that, the whole idea of saying something, and then NEITHER person in the debate diving into that and properly discussing it, leaves the whole thing unresolved.

This same thing happens on news interviews. It’s all for clicks and views and none of this is for serious discussion and it harms everyone.

There was a real chance to have a deep review of the conservative belief system and how fundamentally broken it is with these kids and that was missed entirely.

I really wish they would actually talk about ONE topic, not be allowed to go off topic, not be allowed to gish gallup, not be allowed to interrupt, and not be allowed to speak in anecdotes, rather they should be only allowed to speak with supporting, verifiable facts from reliable sources.

If that sort of thing were to happen, I think we could possibly break through some of the lies these people have been told and get to some actual reality.

As it is, it’s just made up talking points from the right based on whatever fox news said last week with zero fact based evidence and this guy basically in a roller coaster of nonsense trying his best to respond to whatever passing thought the opponent yammers out as they do their best not to let him speak.

It wasn’t just this woman, it was all of them. The whole thing is an exercise in frustration and since nothing of substance ever gets addressed, it just wound up deepening each sides resolve with no actual forward movement to common understanding or agreement.

I hate everything about the whole situation, but it makes for amazing rage bait and gets all the clicks and views, so here we all are talking about it.

He enlisted in the Marines at 17, lied about his age, could’ve just waited for his draft number to come up after turning 18, but he was ready to go to Vietnam. He served 6 tours there; he kept volunteering to go back, partly because he wanted to take the place of men who had wives and kids back home, and partly because he struggled to adjust after coming home. 

So. My entire childhood centered around his undiagnosed and untreated PTSD, because the military abandoned him. Back then, mental health was not a priority. Thank you for your service, now fuck off. So he self medicated with alcohol, which often caused violent outbursts and flashbacks. He’d mistake me for Viet Cong and beat me within an inch of my life regularly. 

But he was a true Patriot, right? 

At least he redeemed himself by voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016. He even went so far as to change his party affiliation. He’d been growing more disgusted by “republican values” since the 80s and 90s, but Trump was the nail in that conservative coffin. If he hadn’t died in 2019, he’d have voted for Biden in 2020 and Harris this year, I know it. 

Since his passing, my mother, of all people, has gone full liberal. It’s absolutely insane to me, having grown up in a house where “bleeding heart liberal” was considered an insult.

This can become an endless cycle as they aren't being paid for their labor and when they are released they will have no where to go but back to the streets where they will once again break these horrible and stupid laws and head back to jail and back to forced labor.

American example: BUILD THE WALL. every idiot and their grandma can understand that people get stopped by walls. but just a wall won't stop anyone, they dig a tunnel or get a boat. and that is completely overlooking WHY people are coming to America. want to stop illegal immigration? make sure that they don't want to leave their own home. that is the only way you stop illegal's coming over the border somehow. 

  
Dutch example: Geert wilders promising that we remove all deductibles (eigen risico) from healthcare, as poor people delay or just don't get healthcare due to that. in a debate with leftists parties he made it a very public point that it should be done NOW, not staggered over a few years. Now his party is in government and all of a sudden it can only be partially removed in 2027 instead of NOW. 

and nobody gives a fuck about the lie because they can spin that simple lie a lot easier than most complex real answers. the leftist's answer in my Dutch example was simple: We fully agree with the sentiment and also think we should remove deductibles HOWEVER we have to investigate the correct route to do this so we do not create issues in healthcare.

Repeating a raft of conservative media talking points proves nothing when you’re not interested in anything but trying to ‘own the libz’. The lack of empathy and self-awareness that it takes to ignore the root causes of all of the issues she mentioned shows that it’s not about solving our problems as a nation but being able to use those problems as some sort of ‘gotcha!’ against those she politically disagrees with. She fails to mention that instances of fires being set and police being murdered in 2020 George Floyd unrest were committed by Trump supporters (Minneapolis police station fire, Oakland police murders). She blows off mentions of Trump instigating January 6th & attempts to overthrow the election. She wants to think she’s so patriotic because her father served in the military, but yet many people engaged in the insurrection and trying to overthrow the election also served in the military and consider themselves ‘patriots’. That word has been bastardized by right-wing extremists in the Trump years just like they bastardized ‘freedom’ during the astroturfing of the Tea Party during the Obama years. Those words lose all meaning under those circumstances. She wants to demonize the increasing homeless population as a byproduct of liberal policies but it’s really about the homeless being victims of Capitalism and Republican politicians having zero will to work on a solution for the issue because it might entail increasing taxes on millionaires & billionaires to do so.

This girl in the video did not espouse a single independent thought. She simply regurgitated a bunch of meaningless talking points to form a word salad that makes her feel informed.

Look at what that women said, she basically repeated the same non point like a dozen times while constantly interrupting him. That's how they ""debate"" now.

I remember the previous video that YT channel posted about the little face conservative man and a clip about a woman blowing up to him about abortion rights. He used that strategy that I just mentioned and, even though that clip was uploaded here as proof of how he lost, in conservative circles it was the opposite since that woman got ""too emotional"" and therefore was apperantly wrong. You could even find comments like that here.

That's how the whole ""facts over feelings"" lie comes from in the first place. Even if you only ""get emotional"" it once in a 50 minute debate, they will crop that clip and constantly use it as proof of them winning.

Does she actually know what that means? Does she assume that all of the USA's allies are somehow less democratic because they all fall under the yoke of socialism and are oppressed by their government forcing their citizens to pay taxes to offer universal health care and to a certain degree standardised education? It must be great being a patriotic American and not having to pay any tax for services... Oh wait they do pay tax. Sorry forgetful socialist unpatriotic me.

I realise that this might be my communist indoctrination talking but I thought the idea of patriotism in America was centred on protecting individual freedoms from the tyranny of a big bad centralised government. But I seem to have got this wrong as what it actually means is local government legislating to define the rights of individuals under the guise that they have the right to frame freedoms because they are closer to them than the federal govt. How community minded nothing says patriotic like your neighbour taking away your individual freedoms. I mean after all it's my nations favourite past time. Shit sorry we're not talking about nineteenth century Britain. My Marxist mind is struggling. 

I also can't quite see why immigration is a problem here. Ahhh it must be that the brown people are all socialist. What a terrible position to be in, surrounded by the red menace just waiting to spread their nefarious ideology in your land. 

That's right nothing says patriotic American like keeping out people fleeing persecution and poverty. Thank god those Native Americans had the good fortune to be able to push back those dastardly protestant nutters. Oh wait that's not how it went. 

You know that funny idea of the separation of church and state that some of those very unpatriotic crusty white men came up with when getting all pissy at the UK for imposing taxes. Pretty sure reading the bible in school was exactly the kind of patriotic act they wanted to avoid. But then again what would I know we have bishops sitting in our upper chamber.

So just to round up for little old Stalinist me. Patriotism in America is about the individuals preventing the federal state from impinging on individual freedoms by legislating on a local level to remove the individual freedoms of those the don't agree with. God bless America.",2,0,0

Are created different. Women orgasms and fall in love and that’s why predators force orgasms on women and men orgasms for sexual release.
The whole premise is wrong and the men who make up these stories about women having abortions are coming from a perspective that women think and respond-like men. I am a women sex is different for us and having sex doesn’t mean the same thing as it does for a man. We don’t get pregnant because we want to have sexual gratification from different men.

They didn't have money for school, they didn't want to go to college, they wanted to get out of the streets that would have claimed their lives even faster, hell... they just wanted to get the fuck out of where they were, but whatever their reasons they made a choice. I will always appreciate veterans. I have military members in my family, but I would remind them that they made a choice. Unless your ass was drafted, you made a choice, and you can't sit there and be pissed off because you feel like you're not getting your due. 

That said, there are a bunch of veterans out there who have had their programs' budgets cut under the Trump administration... money that actually really is their due, and not just some ""I'm a veteran, so I should automatically be respected"" mindset.

what democrat is supporting all the ""drugs coming in"" and human trafficking?

loqq6nn,,Alien_Octave042,"He still never answered the question but to be fair she completely derailed this conversations as soon as he started to make a point. I have a few points, though. Firstly that Republican patriotism is extremely performative. They tout freedom and liberty while trampling over freedom to make Healthcare decisions, freedom to live and express your gender as you feel, equal opportunity at wealth and the American dream. Or at least equal opportunity to make a sustainable living. They act like the Constitution is so important to them but they abandon it as soon as it contradicts with their agenda. Liberals may protest but that's not unpatriotic. That is free speech and it is extremely American. Book bannings prove that Republicans don't care about the ideals that they claim to stand for. They don't care about free speech, they care about the freedom to hate and discriminate. They don't care about the Constitution, they care about what it can do for them. Freedom of worship should not be under attack, but that goes for all religions. Nobody should say that you can't worship who you want where you want, but neither should schools be required to teach your kids religious values. Nor should America be expected to prop up any institution of religion as characteristic of American ideals. America is a melting pot of different races and religions, and none should be respected more than another. Another point for abortion is the separation of Church and State. Most non-religious people tend to be in favor of some level of abortion access, and even most religions allow for caveats (although this doesn't fully address the issue). You will probably not be aggressively pro-life unless you have a specifically evangelical Christian/conservative background. And non-Christian people should not be forced to live by Christian standards. Patriotism is not defined by conservative Christian values. In fact, these values contradict the very essence of what it means to be American. There are a lot more points that somebody far smarter than I could make. I'm not very good at debates and this is just off the top of my head.",1,0,0

The argument many of these anti abortion people are making, is that life starts at conception. As in, the moment the egg is fertilized by sperm.

Now an IUD has two main ways it prevents pregnancy. The first one is that it changes cervical mucus so that it kills sperm when sperm gets there. This is very effective, but not 100% guaranteed success rate.

The other way IUD's prevent pregnancy is by changing the uterine wall so that if fertilization occurs, the egg cannot implant itself onto the uterine wall.

lotlhlm,lostd0x,Aozi,"> Why does one side care if it's called a baby?

Because it's incredibly dishonest. That clump of cells is by no means what most people would refer to as, a baby. 

It's potentially a baby in the future, maybe if there's no miscarriage or any other fatal complications, but that clump of cells is most definitely not a baby in the sense that most people use the word baby.

Calling it a baby is purely an argument to emotion, it's meant to appeal to peoples sense of parental care and protection. You know babies, you love babies, they're cute and adorable and all that, and abortion is literally killing babies!!!! 

>And why does the other side care what the other does with their bodies so much that they want to remove choice?

Are you dumb? 

The other side thinks you're killing babies, they do not want you to kill babies, because they see that clump of cells as baby. They think killing babies is wrong, thus they do not want women to have access to killing babies.

Like, there's a very clear ideological difference there that you probably could have figured out if you spent literally a minute thinking about what you just wrote.

>Can't we just meet in the middle?

The fuck is the middle here? One side wants to retain a womans access to abortion, the other side wants to remove abortion in general as an option for any reason.
