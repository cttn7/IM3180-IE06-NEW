 And I'm not sure if they're aware, but they live in Singapore. We have close relations with the star, not the watermelon. So what happens when two countries have close relations with each other? They collaborate. The local universities here WILL have ties with them, it's just a fact.

 I think the reason there is such a strong sentiment is because while it's not the most recent, it has a very major resurgence in recent times and has been an ongoing conflict, and while it may not affect the objectively greatest number of people, when you consider the proportion compared to the Palestine population √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù and particularly horrific statistics like the number of dead children and infants, the number of bloodlines that have ended, the many documented (photo/video evidence, Israeli soldiers proudly talking abt what they've done) heinous war crimes √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù it shows as an especially egregious situation thay desperately needs to be stopped. While other conflicts may not be """"as bad"""", the genocide of Palestine is a very pressing situation because if nothing continues to be done by those in power there is a genuine chance that the gebocide will succeed at the rate of deaths and bombings √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù not to mention the fact that Israel is even bombing other surrounding countries like Lebanon that have nothing to do with it!
 
 To compare with the Russia-Ukraine thing again, Ukraine was still able to receive support from other countries/NATO and able to escape to other countries. Palestinians are trapped within their occupied country and a huge majority of the aid that people are trying to send are being blocked/cut off by Israel. 
 
 Another aspect is definitely social media, since Israel has been trying to silence Palestinian voices online talking about the truth of their situation, many outsiders are using their own platforms to speak out for them where Palestinians cannot. I do admit there is a bit of an issue of people focusing on Palestine alone when there are other huge issues √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù such as what's going on in Congo currently, which is absolutely horrific √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù that also need people's attention, but I guess it's better than nothing, honestly.",6,0,0,261,260

The poster is not blaming u for this, it is empowering you to know this. Knowledge is power, critical thinking is in short supply. Pls set aside your ego, and consider this objectively. 
 
 2. Why are ppl here making this a religious issue? Ask yourself this - yes, religion might tether some ppl here to the tragedy, but do u really think ppl are voicing out their opinons cuz of their religion? Or are they seeing ppl murdered and advocating for a stop? If you are informed by a patriotic sense of duty to nation, making you analyse this with a relgious lens -- arent you informed by a religious fervour to your nation more than ppl are infleunced by religion to stop civilains dying?
 
 3. Lastly, how did this comment make you feel? Are you offended? Why? Is it because I am challening your beliefs or as someone here put it, being ""fanatical to the Palestinian side"". Why is being against killing civilians fanatism? And before anyone brings this talking point up - I am against the killing of civilains in all sides. I condemn Hamas, and I condemn Bibi and Bengevir's Israel. I do not codemn Palestinians and Israelis. 
 
 I am proud to be aSingaporean BUT I recognise that my country is unbashedly supporting genocide. Sit with this line for a bit. What this means is that, you can feel a certain sense of belonging to your community, and at the same time be able criticise it. If you disagree with -- wont you call this religious fanatism?

 We have enough examples given in this thread on how many components of our lives are 'complicit' so what do we do? 
 
 2. I think why some of us prescribe this as a religious issue is because some lofty individuals have very often determined our moral compass by how loud we seem to be on social platforms. From what I can see, most of the Muslims are comparatively driven about this issue due to the Muslim population in Gaza. Yes there are other religious populations but the majority of them are Muslim. 
 
 Am I wrong if I am not as vocal about it as you are on the issue? We are people of different backgrounds and different life experiences. Say I am a Chinese Taoist taxi driver who has been poor my whole life, my platform would be devoted to protesting about the 9% gst. Am I wrong if I don't connect to the Gazans as much as you? Isn't it the same for the Muslims who have absolutely no regard for the ongoing civil war and daily death tolls in Myanmar? Can I blame the Muslims if they don't connect to the people living there and aren't as vocal as I am? Yes it is a humanitarian issue in Gaza but am I criticised if I am seemingly less committed to the cause since I connect to other issues more?

 Anyway, lemme summarise my thoughts briefly. Particularly on the religious part.
 
 i think our curriculum teaches us to think of any geopolitical issue from a religious lens as the idea of harmony triumphs all here. Religion might tether Muslims here - but it is not the main reason. It would help us if we understood this nuance. 
 
 secondly, i think I am not attacking you for not having a stance on this. much less, on supporting Israel. I am simply wondering why ppl who have a stance on this are infantilised as religious? Is that the only thing motivating their stance? Humanity doesnt come into play.
 
 I think the classic SGrean mindset of ""it doesnt affect me, why should i care"" is at full speed here. one redditor even has something nasty to say along this lines if u go down a few comments. my view is -- why doesnt humanity come into play as a factor here? And before you reply with a ""what about the Houthis situation"", let us try to analyse this with specificity, and let us not fall pray to whataboutism.",-1,0,0,327,326
kt4j6xl,kt4eb8h,Southern_Candle_1795,"1. The casual use of the word genocide is devaluing it as a word. Statistically, if this was a genocide, it is the lousiest and most inefficient genocide in human history. Seriously, tens of thousands of airstrikes/bombs and ONLY 20k deaths? Keep in mind just 1 bomb can level NTU Hive. 
 
 Knowledge is power. Correct. So use the word √¢‚Ç¨Àúgenocide√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ appropriately. Go and critically think about the death toll vs ordinance drop. If it was a genocide, death toll would easily be over 2 million for the same number of bombs dropped. Refugee camps and hospitals would have been bombed to oblivion. Water would have been cut off permanently. 
 
 Is whats happening a tragedy? Yes. Is it a genocide? No. 
 
 U want to know whats a real modern genocide? Go and google √¢‚Ç¨ÀúMariupol√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢. Absolute systematic indiscriminate destruction of the entire city. 
 
 2. Then why only on Israel - Hamas conflict? Houthis in Yemen has been over a decade. North Korea on its own civilians has been over half a century. China in Xinjiang has also been a decade. Or Myanmar Junta. Yet you dont see this kind of posters targetting the other parties. Why? Anti-Semites. They are the ones making this a religious issue. 
 
 
 3. Again, why suddenly target Israel conflict only? Whats so different here compared to Myanmar/Yemen/China/NK? Main common difference is that Israelis are mostly Jewish.

k5enx8u,post,SteelSW,"What's happening to Nadine is really sad but my main thing is that this was foreseen.
 
 The main issue was always that that LinkedIn post, even when prefaced by saying ""this information came from the discussions in r/NTU"" or something along those lines wasn't enough to shift the blame to Reddit's unhinged discussions but rather since it was accompanied with Nadine's opinions on future actions that might be able to be taken against Ethan based on those uncontrolled rumors (Ethan wanting to get a confession out of the victim, for example). With that, this lawsuit became scarily viable for Ethan to pursue because as difficult as it is to prove romantic feelings weren't involved in the court of law, it's also as difficult if not harder to prove that they were, especially considering Nadine's position as an NUS and not an NTU student, not even minding the possibility of being a SU student that might see or know people that have seen Ethan's behaviors.
 
 But I want to stress that Ethan's public perception, which is also shared by me, is dogwater thanks to this lawsuit. I get it, Ethan is *probably* trying to recoup reputational and potential future loss of career fees, which unfortunately I think is fair as this post was directly put up on LinkedIn for a reason I presume. But not even giving her an option to just take down the post or settle things personally without immediately giving her a lawsuit threat is insanely scummy to me and probably a lot of you. Because it looks to us as if it's not Ethan trying to get back his lost career and reputation, it looks a lot like he's trying to cause the most damage to Nadine financially because he can.
 
 What's happening to Nadine is insanely saddening and Ethan's a piece of crap, but I can only wonder that the reason this happened in the first place is due to the unsubstantiated accusations laid upon Ethan here on r/NTU under the guise of anonymity influencing Nadine's decision to put the LinkedIn post with those claims forward to begin with.
 
 &#x200B;
 
 Edit: Mods have restored Nadine's comment and it seems that the initial email was a warning letter. My point still stands, that's a scummy move, I don't think anyone would just fork over $100,000 without a fight or even apologize for something that at the time seemed like reasonable statements, which I *predict* is something Ethan's lawyers knew and sent the letter with that in mind (therefore pressuring her to fight and exhausting her finances).",149,0,0,378,0

k5i2nka,k5hl74l,SteelSW,"I don't think defending yourself from defamation is scummy. That being said, there are better ways to do this when you're trying to save face or your reputation. I call back to the initial Letter of Demand, that demands Nadine hand over $100,000 regardless of her action to apologize and take down the post. That's where I'd say is going over the line, I think at the point where you commit to a public apology to the extent of big public news providers and the deletion of the initial LinkedIn post is where at the very least you can clear some things up efficiently.
 
 Think about it this way, if this wasn't a method to scrape money or make an example out of someone by financially exhausting them and truly to protect himself from defamation then in Ethan's Letter of Demand it would have taken a more appropriate approach, linger the $100,000 if the demands aren't meant instead of enforcing it anyhow and invite for discussion. Theoretically this should be enough pressure for Nadine to care without coercing her into trying to fight back and incurring legal fees. Nadine at that point was his biggest third-party detractor, if he wants to clear up his name, an apology after discussions of the truths of the matter by that detractor would be more efficient at recovering his name, no?
 
 Yes, people can consider the temporary reputational damages to be compensated via the enforced $100,000, but think of it down the line when this news becomes old news and Ethan pursues a career. In this case, investigations into Ethan's backgrounds would see that they were embroiled in controversy and the situation was subsequently rectified with what truly happened if he sought for discussion.
 
 All that said, all this would be viable for Ethan... If he would've actually put up a proper apology instead of a corporatized statement on the Straits Times. So yeah, defending yourself? Fair play. Can I still say it's scummy with the methods involved? I can and think that my interpretation is just. 
 
 You can disagree if you want, it's your opinion, you can defend it too with analysis, or not I'm not going to judge you, it's your life. I'm just adding to the discussion to try to add the grey perspective that it isn't one side is wrong the other is right, or which is more wrong than who, I'm trying to get people to understand that you can admit Ethan is not the best human being while also understanding how the lawsuit is fair even if it utilized what I'd call scummy practices.",18,0,0,392,391

I don't blame Ethan for using those tactics because that's really just how it is, and he was also in a very emotionally charged and even vulnerable state. For all you know, the lawyer might recommend these actions instead of taking his instructions.
 
 I believe people like Nadine should not be let off so easily with just a slap on the wrist for the kind of damage she can do. It is ridiculous that people think it's OK or trivial that she did what she did. No one has imagined a scenario where they were accused of a crime they did not commit, and some random mentally ill girl makes a LinkedIn post that goes viral. Just a simple ""sorry"" and a few thousand dollars is not justice. But yes, $100,000 is ridiculous, but that was never my focus. As for the apology in the newspaper - I don't feel it's overboard. I've seen people put up apologies for trivial stuff. She is accusing him of being a sexual predator and criminal and has stated her intentions of threatening his future career. It's Ethan's right to ask for what makes him feel whole, and whether the judge agrees or not is another matter.",16,0,0,393,392
k5ip5d3,k5i4q53,SteelSW,"Agreed as well and completely valid opinion.
 
 I don't really understand what you mean on apologies being overboard. If it's Nadine's I think that's fair play too, hell if Ethan wanted his reputation restored that's a great way to do so after one-on-one discussion on the facts.
 
 If it's Ethan's, I thought it was just disingenuous ([this one](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ex-ntu-student-leader-apologises-for-alcohol-related-incident-involving-female-junior)). It feels so corporatized, it doesn't feel like an apology but an attempt at defense. I think that it was correct to reach out to the Straits, especially if the issue had blown up, but the wordings he used were robotic at best and didn't feel like an admission of guilt and a promise to do better, but as if he'd always been better and that he had done nothing wrong. 
 
 Which I think as many of us here on the forum would say, inadvertently spiking someone is a gross violation of consent and obviously, something wrong.

 My original logic is she should just pay if she is not remorseful and unwilling to make amends. If she can't afford it, she should be looking for a way out. Clearly she can ""just pay"" since she is fighting the suit by lawyering up. No apology to be seen and she has already paid a 5 figure sum to lawyers already.

 Of course, there's always the courtroom. But it's also very important how the public perceives a person. Take, for example, the double Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey. In late July this year, he was acquitted *by a jury* in England of multiple charges of sexual assault: [source](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/26/kevin-spacey-cleared-of-sexually-assaulting-four-men). However, this did not stop a London theatre from cancelling a movie premiere in which he stars only as a *voice actor* \- i.e. doesn't even appear on screen: [here](https://variety.com/2023/film/global/kevin-spacey-control-premiere-canceled-sexual-assault-trial-1235757051/). It was reported that the person who runs the location, Greg Lynn, said:
 
 >√¢‚Ç¨≈ìLast night it came to our attention that your film features Kevin Spacey, in particular his first film since the court case,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Lynn continued. √¢‚Ç¨≈ì**My staff as well as I are horrified that we are being mentioned in the same breath as his new film for the premiere.**√¢‚Ç¨¬ù
 
 Obviously, we don't know exactly *why* this person was horrified. It could be for any number of reasons. But given that the criminal trial was in the UK (and publicised all around the world) *and, more importantly*, prior to this Kevin Spacey did not face any career-threatening accusations on this scale or gravity, one has to be naive to believe that these sexual assault allegations against Spacey weren't a factor on Mr Lynn's mind.

 To clarify, I messed up the terminology the first time and mistakenly said I was being sued, when it was merely a Letter of Demand. Which is like a warning letter. After my lawyer responded, they said they would sue. And now they have mounted the /actual/ lawsuit. I apologize for not being able to respond to the comments from last time, because I was being PM'ed immense amounts of shit. Likewise, this time I'll be avoiding social media and just posting any updates on my IG. My Reddit DMs are closed. You can call me whatever you like, make rape and death threats, I heard it all the first time and I won't be even reading them this time.
 
 I just want to mention here that I will not be setting up a GFM, I don't believe in taking money from people especially because many people reading this who've expressed willingness to donate are university students just like me, and that's just not the right thing to do imo. I don't want to take anybody's money. IF YOU SEE A GFM, IT IS NOT ME. 
 
 At this stage, ""just apologize"" to Ethan is not going to work, because the lawsuit has commenced, and he may ask for damages, similar to the original Letter of Demand asking for $100k and for me to pay for a $7k advertising spot to post a public apology. That's really all I can say right now. At this point, no matter what happens, I have lost already, because I'll have to fork out money to defend against this. And it is my parents' money, which ramps up the guilt.

 just a few points:
 
 1. there is no way he will get 100k if he goes to trial. 100k lies within the range of defaming public figures like LKY and LHL. he is nowhere near a public figure, and im sure your lawyers have advised you accordingly.
 
 
 2. his entire strat is very transparent - commence proceedings, make you incur expensive legal fees until you are desperate, and you have to settle on his terms. i leave that to your lawyers to advise, but at this stage you don't really have leverage to get a good deal. unless -
 
 
 3. you plead defence of truth / justification / fair comment, and take out discovery application against him and ask for all the relevant documents to prove that whatever you are saying is true or fair comment. see the Rachel Wong defamation case against Olivia Wu, whereby Olivia got a discovery order for Rachel to disclose all her (among others) text messages to prove her infidelity. these documents will be part of the public record. put the allegations against him solely in issue before the court. but again, you should get your lawyers to advise you accordingly. 
 
 
 legal fees can get very expensive and i hope you got a good and kind lawyer willing to do some low bono for you. all the best!

k5fg3jc,k5fc6nh,Ok_Pomegranate634,"then the question is - settle on what terms? if ethan will only settle (at best) at 70k for example, she might as well fight it out since there's a more than even chance she can succeed in court and pay nothing to ethan while paying maybe say 50k to her lawyers. and given her position at the moment, she unfortunately is unlikely to have any leverage to demand that she will only settle if ethan drops his claims or she will only pay a nominal sum. 
 
 of course, there is always the risk that she will lose in court and thus having to pay money to ethan + costs + her own legal fees. but like i said, it can fairly be said that there is a fair chance that ethan will not get 100k. the figure is quite ridiculous. in the soh rui yong case, ashley liew was given 120k for *five* defamatory statements made by SRY (ie around 24k per statement). this one only got one, and ashley liew - being a former sportsman - is arguably more prominent than a mere NTU student.

 2. getting off social media might help. please do reach out to a trusted professional (therapist/counsellor) if it's within your capacity to do so too. 
 
 3. you will see this through. you will go on exchange and have fun overseas.

 2)why is she relevant to Ethan/NTU/the girl who got drunk
 
 3)why LinkedIn
 
 
 i have so, so many questions. i could be wrong (i hope i am) but i was quite bewildered to find out Nadine was some random girl not even present on the day of the incident, not even a friend of the girl, not even from the Student Union, not even from the actual school. i know there must be justice but going on your vigilante ways is bad advice. would've gotten more achieved by, i don't know, creating a GFM to sue him for the incident on the drunk girl's behalf or something. or forwarding a campaign to letter-write NTU to hell, IDK. all said and done, going to such lengths for someone you don't know (did she ask her to do this? i doubt but i don't know for sure) and getting this mess in return is simply not worth it. it's a good cause, but in terms of value, it's just not it. pretty dark but i'm willing to bet deep down at least a small part of Nadine wishes she never touched the issue in the first place.

 Ethan does not need the money. Moreover, the linkedin post damages could, however it is improbable that it would amount to 100k. What he is trying to do is to teach nadine a lesson.

He knows it is highly unlikely she will be able to pay the amount he asked for. This also directs the attention away from the original alcohol inicident.

k5u17qk,k5o1mb3,depetir,"Lots of things that are ""not illegal"" but still very concerning precursors where there is a need to step in and do some kind of re-education or correction, in this case where NTU did none.

You don't just leave it be like NTU did. And if NTU is incapable of correcting this kind of behaviour (as they have repeatedly shown), someone else needs to step in. 
 
 Besides, NTU is an organisation we give a significant amounts of money to. By your logic, we can't complain if NTU doesn't put the money towards building 10 more gardens and doesn't care about student wellbeing and teaching quality since it's ""not illegal""? 
 
 To reduce his behaviour to the equivalent of cheating just shows how much you don't care about crime done on women and the events leading up to it. You keep saying you're not defending him but that's like 90% of what you use your account for. You don't want to go into whether or not his actions were correct, even though it is obviously wrong, and try to play the centrist. This isn't neutrality and objectivity. When you swing towards the middle even though the facts point to another side, it's just veering towards the side with less sound logic.

 (Looks at downvoted advice from before)
 
 Sounds like she made the unwise decision of trying to fight it out instead of apologising unreservedly the initial LoD and suggesting a token sum to settle. If she had done that, he would have dropped case since it's not cheap for him either to proceed beyond LoD.
 
 Girl ah girl, why you follow all the upvoted Redditor comments asking you to go and fight? Already warned that doing that was terrible unwise and would cause you to end up in a world of hurt. Those jokers who gave wrong advice can just delete comments (I see a lot of them already) or make new account.
 
 Sorry but there is no chance you are winning this case, and 2 things are big knocks against you:
 
 1, you are a year 2 lawyer, meaning you'll definitely be looked at by the judge as someone who should have known better.
 
 2: all the ""helpful"" Redditors who so happily went to sound out how they thought Ethan was a douche *after* your LinkedIn post. Because all those ""helpful"" posts have became ammo for him: proof that his reputation had been damaged by you. Normally I'll advise you to ask these unhelpful helpful people to take down, but pointless by now as his lawyers would definitely have already captured.
 
 What you can do now is just apologise unreservedly and offer a token sum of compensation (the price of the LoD, 1k maybe) and hope he has the mercy to stop the case. Stop listening to bad advice - it's not their money that's going to be lost. It's yours.",2,0,0,623,0

 Except: ""A recent study has found that individuals with higher levels of narcissistic traits are more likely to be involved in feminist activism. This research suggests that for some, activism may serve not just as a platform for societal change, but also as a means to fulfill personal, egocentric needs. The findings have been published in Current Psychology.
 
 The study was inspired by the idea that while many engage in activism for altruistic reasons or due to direct personal impact by the issues at hand, others might be motivated by less noble desires, such as the fulfillment of narcissistic needs. This notion aligns with the concept that activism can be used as a vehicle for individuals to achieve personal gains, such as attention, status, or fame.
 
 √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBased on the results of a previous study, in which we investigated the relationship between dark personality traits (e.g., narcissism) and anti-sexual assault activism, we were interested to further explore the notion that some individuals may be involved in certain forms of activism (i.e., feminist activism) to (merely) **satisfy their own ego-focused needs (instead of prosocial goals)**,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù explained study authors Ann Krispenz, a postdoctoral associate, and Professor Alex Bertrams, the head of the Division of Educational Psychology of the University of Bern.""",1,0,0,696,0

 I'm also from Social Sciences but not soci so pardon my lack of understanding and if I jump the gun in my chain of logic for this. As for power dynamics and history. In short, is it just the implication that racism essentially brings systemic discrimination and suppression towards certain groups for a trait that they have no control over. And this would naturally have far reaching effects generations into the future which is where we are now, and the problem does still persist to every extent.

 My thoughts on the situation are just that it's improper and proliferates negative stereotypes, especially for a person in a position of power. People who initially disagree with it might end up agreeing just to stay in good graces with the others in the group. If such a dynamic exists, especially within a group chat that supposedly represents the student body, it's vile.
 
 I wasn't even sure what race you were, and it did not matter to me when I was approaching the topic of overgeneralisation of the chinese. I don't think two wrongs make a right.

I think your culture is just weak... You already lost in food. No need to talk about east asian cuisine / south asian cuisine in the west... Chinese food is king there and the varieties and styles makes even Japanese cuisine (the runner up) look small and limited in comparison despite all the extra marketing and better image of japan than china. South asian? Curry. Done,1,1,2,887,886

 The drinking session was held on Oct 15, 2022 in Ethan√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Hall of Residence room after a union committee meeting, according to Xinruo. She said a total of six union members attended, including her, Ethan, then-NTUSU president, then-NTUSU chief of staff and two other union Exco members. 
 
 It also noted that a complaint, which was filed in September, did not report any form of sexual misconduct and the investigation also did not find any sexual misconduct as alleged in some social media posts. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe university is concerned by some comments posted online and urges online users to refrain from making speculative and unsubstantiated allegations,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù said NTU.

 he is guilty of nothing, despite you trying to to couch it in ""legalistic"" jargon. Hello, how can one be guilty when there is no law in the books for the crime you are talking about? There was no contact whatsoever and no outrage of modesty, indecent comments etc. 
 
 You are simply profiling him - like a woman who allege a guy is sexually harassing her because he look in her direction for too long, and so happens his eyes are in the direction of her boobs. 
 
 If what Ethan did can be charged as sexual crime, then a burglar who force his way into a young woman home at night can be given the additional charge of potential rape/molest/outrage of modesty simply because it contains the element of young woman, alone and force into her home at night which might be similar situation where such forceful sex crime occurred. Then we can also automatically assume they have the intention to rape but copped out at the last minute, because think of all the women sleeping at home at night.
