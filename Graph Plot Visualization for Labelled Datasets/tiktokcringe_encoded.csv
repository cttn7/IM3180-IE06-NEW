Every thing she mentioned was its own entire concept and should have been discussed separately.

So, there obviously is no moderation, which there should have been to shut down the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna talk over you so everyone knows I‚Äôm right‚Äù bullsh*#.

Beyond that, the whole idea of saying something, and then NEITHER person in the debate diving into that and properly discussing it, leaves the whole thing unresolved.

This same thing happens on news interviews. It‚Äôs all for clicks and views and none of this is for serious discussion and it harms everyone.

There was a real chance to have a deep review of the conservative belief system and how fundamentally broken it is with these kids and that was missed entirely.

I really wish they would actually talk about ONE topic, not be allowed to go off topic, not be allowed to gish gallup, not be allowed to interrupt, and not be allowed to speak in anecdotes, rather they should be only allowed to speak with supporting, verifiable facts from reliable sources.

If that sort of thing were to happen, I think we could possibly break through some of the lies these people have been told and get to some actual reality.

As it is, it‚Äôs just made up talking points from the right based on whatever fox news said last week with zero fact based evidence and this guy basically in a roller coaster of nonsense trying his best to respond to whatever passing thought the opponent yammers out as they do their best not to let him speak.

It wasn‚Äôt just this woman, it was all of them. The whole thing is an exercise in frustration and since nothing of substance ever gets addressed, it just wound up deepening each sides resolve with no actual forward movement to common understanding or agreement.

I hate everything about the whole situation, but it makes for amazing rage bait and gets all the clicks and views, so here we all are talking about it.

He served 6 tours there; he kept volunteering to go back, partly because he wanted to take the place of men who had wives and kids back home, and partly because he struggled to adjust after coming home. 

So. My entire childhood centered around his undiagnosed and untreated PTSD, because the military abandoned him. Back then, mental health was not a priority. Thank you for your service, now fuck off. So he self medicated with alcohol, which often caused violent outbursts and flashbacks. He‚Äôd mistake me for Viet Cong and beat me within an inch of my life regularly.

it's the standard route for populist campaigning: promise fast and easy to understand solutions to very complex problems, then when elected it doesnt matter if you do it. 

  
American example: BUILD THE WALL. every idiot and their grandma can understand that people get stopped by walls. but just a wall won't stop anyone, they dig a tunnel or get a boat. and that is completely overlooking WHY people are coming to America. want to stop illegal immigration? make sure that they don't want to leave their own home. that is the only way you stop illegal's coming over the border somehow. 

  
Dutch example: Geert wilders promising that we remove all deductibles (eigen risico) from healthcare, as poor people delay or just don't get healthcare due to that. in a debate with leftists parties he made it a very public point that it should be done NOW, not staggered over a few years. Now his party is in government and all of a sudden it can only be partially removed in 2027 instead of NOW. 

and nobody gives a fuck about the lie because they can spin that simple lie a lot easier than most complex real answers. the leftist's answer in my Dutch example was simple: We fully agree with the sentiment and also think we should remove deductibles HOWEVER we have to investigate the correct route to do this so we do not create issues in healthcare.

The lack of empathy and self-awareness that it takes to ignore the root causes of all of the issues she mentioned shows that it‚Äôs not about solving our problems as a nation but being able to use those problems as some sort of ‚Äògotcha!‚Äô against those she politically disagrees with. She fails to mention that instances of fires being set and police being murdered in 2020 George Floyd unrest were committed by Trump supporters (Minneapolis police station fire, Oakland police murders). She blows off mentions of Trump instigating January 6th & attempts to overthrow the election. She wants to think she‚Äôs so patriotic because her father served in the military, but yet many people engaged in the insurrection and trying to overthrow the election also served in the military and consider themselves ‚Äòpatriots‚Äô. That word has been bastardized by right-wing extremists in the Trump years just like they bastardized ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô during the astroturfing of the Tea Party during the Obama years. Those words lose all meaning under those circumstances. She wants to demonize the increasing homeless population as a byproduct of liberal policies but it‚Äôs really about the homeless being victims of Capitalism and Republican politicians having zero will to work on a solution for the issue because it might entail increasing taxes on millionaires & billionaires to do so.

This girl in the video did not espouse a single independent thought. She simply regurgitated a bunch of meaningless talking points to form a word salad that makes her feel informed.

We dont force them to do blood donations. We dont force them to donate sperm or eggs. 

This means we also cant force a womans consent to offer her body to grow a baby. And she is allowed to take away her consent for any reason, jsut as i can ask a nurse to stop my blood donation at any point. Just as i can leave a hospital right before they prep me for surgery to donate a kidney. It may be unfair for another human, but its perfectly legal.

Does she actually know what that means? Does she assume that all of the USA's allies are somehow less democratic because they all fall under the yoke of socialism and are oppressed by their government forcing their citizens to pay taxes to offer universal health care and to a certain degree standardised education? It must be great being a patriotic American and not having to pay any tax for services... Oh wait they do pay tax. Sorry forgetful socialist unpatriotic me.

I realise that this might be my communist indoctrination talking but I thought the idea of patriotism in America was centred on protecting individual freedoms from the tyranny of a big bad centralised government. But I seem to have got this wrong as what it actually means is local government legislating to define the rights of individuals under the guise that they have the right to frame freedoms because they are closer to them than the federal govt. How community minded nothing says patriotic like your neighbour taking away your individual freedoms. I mean after all it's my nations favourite past time. Shit sorry we're not talking about nineteenth century Britain. My Marxist mind is struggling. 

I also can't quite see why immigration is a problem here. Ahhh it must be that the brown people are all socialist. What a terrible position to be in, surrounded by the red menace just waiting to spread their nefarious ideology in your land. 

That's right nothing says patriotic American like keeping out people fleeing persecution and poverty. Thank god those Native Americans had the good fortune to be able to push back those dastardly protestant nutters. Oh wait that's not how it went. 

You know that funny idea of the separation of church and state that some of those very unpatriotic crusty white men came up with when getting all pissy at the UK for imposing taxes. Pretty sure reading the bible in school was exactly the kind of patriotic act they wanted to avoid. But then again what would I know we have bishops sitting in our upper chamber.

So just to round up for little old Stalinist me. Patriotism in America is about the individuals preventing the federal state from impinging on individual freedoms by legislating on a local level to remove the individual freedoms of those the don't agree with. God bless America.",2,0,0,840,0

I will always appreciate veterans. I have military members in my family, but I would remind them that they made a choice. Unless your ass was drafted, you made a choice, and you can't sit there and be pissed off because you feel like you're not getting your due.

lop8l9w,post,The_Disapyrimid,"conservatives in the US seem to have a skewed version of ""patriotism"". what they really mean is nationalism.

their view seems to be there is only one singular way to be an American. if you are not in a ""nuclear family"" then you are not american. if you support symbolic protests like burring a flag you aren't ""patriotic"" because nationalism is quasi religious with the flag being its holy symbol. same for the anthem, its a religious symbol for them and is therefore so sacred you HAVE TO show it the utmost resect and never us it as a form of protest(like kneeling or just not participating). or you should worship at the feet of soldiers(she literally says ""kneeling for those who have sacrificed"") instead of judging them the same way you would anyone else. you can be a shitbag in the military just like anyone not in the military. you don't get a free pass just for being in the military.

she talks about all the trash and homelessness in LA, yet i'm from Mississippi and seen plenty of trash and had to step over used needles on the side of the road while walking my dog. and this was in a rural area. not a democrat run city like Jackson. just because its not concentrated in one or two areas, like in large cities, doesn't mean the same sort of homelessness and drug issues don't exist in rural, more conservative areas.

what democrat is supporting all the ""drugs coming in"" and human trafficking?

no one is supporting christians being forced to hide their religion. telling christians they can't force their religion on everyone by law is not oppressive towards christians. its preventing christians from oppressing others.

abortion is healthcare.

Policies: helping the working class by holding the wealthy accountable to pay fairly, protect the safety of, and not exploit their workers. Instituting public safety measures to prevent deaths of essential workers vs saying things like ""old people should be willing to die to keep the economy strong"" ala Lt Govenor of TX. We should fund programs which care for veterans that have been injured in our last couple of decades of wars unlike conservatives who regularly vote down funding for the VA. Funding programs to care for the first responders from 9/11 which liberals like John Stewart fought tooth and nail for and are still fighting to preserve with the biggest opponents being greedy conservatives. We are working to preserve ACTUAL religious freedom by standing up against those that wish to institute a Christian theocracy. Progressives are working to ensure freedom of amd FROM religion for ALL not just one sect of one religion like conservatives are.

As far as the protests, that is the most American thing to do.

loqq6nn,post,Alien_Octave042,"He still never answered the question but to be fair she completely derailed this conversations as soon as he started to make a point. I have a few points, though. Firstly that Republican patriotism is extremely performative. They tout freedom and liberty while trampling over freedom to make Healthcare decisions, freedom to live and express your gender as you feel, equal opportunity at wealth and the American dream. Or at least equal opportunity to make a sustainable living. They act like the Constitution is so important to them but they abandon it as soon as it contradicts with their agenda. Liberals may protest but that's not unpatriotic. That is free speech and it is extremely American. Book bannings prove that Republicans don't care about the ideals that they claim to stand for. They don't care about free speech, they care about the freedom to hate and discriminate. They don't care about the Constitution, they care about what it can do for them. Freedom of worship should not be under attack, but that goes for all religions. Nobody should say that you can't worship who you want where you want, but neither should schools be required to teach your kids religious values. Nor should America be expected to prop up any institution of religion as characteristic of American ideals. America is a melting pot of different races and religions, and none should be respected more than another. Another point for abortion is the separation of Church and State. Most non-religious people tend to be in favor of some level of abortion access, and even most religions allow for caveats (although this doesn't fully address the issue). You will probably not be aggressively pro-life unless you have a specifically evangelical Christian/conservative background. And non-Christian people should not be forced to live by Christian standards. Patriotism is not defined by conservative Christian values. In fact, these values contradict the very essence of what it means to be American. There are a lot more points that somebody far smarter than I could make.

The argument many of these anti abortion people are making, is that life starts at conception. As in, the moment the egg is fertilized by sperm.

Now an IUD has two main ways it prevents pregnancy. The first one is that it changes cervical mucus so that it kills sperm when sperm gets there. This is very effective, but not 100% guaranteed success rate.

The other way IUD's prevent pregnancy is by changing the uterine wall so that if fertilization occurs, the egg cannot implant itself onto the uterine wall.

lotlhlm,lostd0x,Aozi,"> Why does one side care if it's called a baby?

Because it's incredibly dishonest. That clump of cells is by no means what most people would refer to as, a baby. 

It's potentially a baby in the future, maybe if there's no miscarriage or any other fatal complications, but that clump of cells is most definitely not a baby in the sense that most people use the word baby.

Calling it a baby is purely an argument to emotion, it's meant to appeal to peoples sense of parental care and protection. You know babies, you love babies, they're cute and adorable and all that, and abortion is literally killing babies!!!! 

>And why does the other side care what the other does with their bodies so much that they want to remove choice?

Are you dumb? 

The other side thinks you're killing babies, they do not want you to kill babies, because they see that clump of cells as baby. They think killing babies is wrong, thus they do not want women to have access to killing babies.

Like, there's a very clear ideological difference there that you probably could have figured out if you spent literally a minute thinking about what you just wrote.

>Can't we just meet in the middle?

The fuck is the middle here? One side wants to retain a womans access to abortion, the other side wants to remove abortion in general as an option for any reason.
