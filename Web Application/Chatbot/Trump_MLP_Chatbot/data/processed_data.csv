"Its amazing that he calls himself a genius.

How many geniuses do you know of who regularly have to explain the ways in which they are a genius? 

There should be psychological studies done on this mans level of narcissism.",0
Any person who feels the need to constantly call themselves a genius is an idiot driven by ego,0
He belongs in r/iamverysmart,1
It would be too easy to flood that sub with the things he's said just in this campaign alone.,0
And what's wrong with that? Please proceed ??,0
"Well, then someone would need to make a whole other sub to publicly shame those acting too big for their britches.",0
"No, he belongs in our memories. Mostly forgotten, but a reminder of how to be better",0
No marker. Just a patch of dirt that won't grow grass.,0
"He should be the mascot for that sub. 

He actually said ""I'm like a very smart person"" because he's so socially illiterate that he doesn't have any idea why people don't normally say things like that. Why that's weird. And why saying that immediately makes you sound like a dumb person. 

This is the kind of basic socialization concept that most of us have mastered by the 5th grade.",0
"Trump at Multiple Rallies: ""who remembers the great American, Hannibal Lecter?!"" ""The late great Hannibal Lecter!"" ""Hannibal Lecter, what a great American he was.""

Everyone not MAGA: ""that's weird. He's a fictional character that was a cannibal""

Trump: ""I was using it as a metaphor for illiegal immigrants.

Oh just F*ck off. All the way off.",0

Someone should introduce Trump to Kanye West. I think they'd really hit it off...,0
"Trump had Kanye in the Oval Office. [He pitched an idea for a new presidential plane called the ""iPlane 1.""](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/11/kanyes-apple-iplane-1-for-trump-was-designed-by-someone-else.html)",0
"They've met. Kanye visited the white house to throw ideas at Trump, then he decided to run on this own bullshit show",0
Yeah I know. I used ... instead of /s. They aren't interchangeable.,0

Of course that turned out to be the one time I was wrong about something, but that is beside the point.",1

Who increasingly looks like shes fighting off crying just while listening to him rant about how he doesnt rant.,0
"She doesn't have feelings to cry with. She's a horrible person who wants to ride Trump's dick... Rolled back child labor laws, sends tax money from public to private schools, stole 20k in tax payer money to go on a European vacation...

Fuck Huck a boo boo.",0
"there's SOMETHING happening behind her eyes during his reply.

at one point i think utter realization kicked in, and she shoved it back down with a vapid smile.

but she DEFINITELY knows he is losing what little brainpower he started with.",0

A comment so nice I liked it twice,0

I am 100% sure trump fucked her at some point. She had whatever Melania had.,0
Honestly they can keep her. She has done so much harm to this state it's on its way to becoming Florida 2.0.,0

No, no, no. We're keeping Whitmer, thank you. We're good.",0

"My family friend works in robotics for factories. He did some work for a nuclear power plant, literally out of curiosity. Like it was a fucking hobby. He's the smartest person I know personally. 

He briefly mentioned one time that he was ""underwhelmed,"" about his understanding of his field of work.",0
"Yeah. truly scarily smart and intelligent people are oblivious to it and don´t care to ruminate to you how smart they are. My best friend married a guy who owns the patent for a type of catheter that pulls blood clots out of your brain, he has a masters in epidemiology and in Ph.D (I have no idea in what) and works in biomedical plastics manufacturing engineering. I think he has a bit of the tism in how he communicates. His brain wave and when talking conversation is so esoteric and dry but he also has a humor that is quite unique. I cannot beat the guy at scrabble how hard I try by the order of hundreds of points. He kept playing me though. He tells us about his job, and his day to day like we understand it but not in a condescending way. He geniunely is sharing. He´s brilliant...and really doesn´t show it or know it it his way.",0
"Almost word for word, that's my family friend. Right down to Scrabble lol. 

Not condescending, has a sense of humor and is slightly nervous socially. We go backpacking with my mom and I love to tap his brain on subjects. He's very matter-of-fact and is incredible explaining topics to a dolt like me.

Salt of the earth, he is. I am fortunate to have been friends with him from 11-35.",0
"I truly enjoy speaking with intelligent, smart, or just plain interesting eloquent people. It tickles my brain. That's why the Idiocracy of the right wing is making me feel downright hopeless and helpless. I ran into a biosystems scientist the other day (I am a home care nurse) he was feeling a weakness that wasn't kosher with the surgery he had so I was questioning him about what was going on. His particular malady was so rare that I had to keep asking him questions in a way that surprised him because most nurses don't go into such detail. I genuinely wanted to learn and in the course of learning about his rare thing it helped me better understand another more common thing in a better way. He was so effusive in his appreciation of my thoroughness that he signed a textbook he wrote about ocean systems so I could learn more. My job can be a slog sometimes but stuff like this just makes me love my job more.",0
"My husband has GOT to be on the spectrum, and has learned how to mask pretty well. He researches damn near everything and always knows the CORRECT way of doing it all. Can be infuriating, but I have to trust that he's got his reasons for doing things a certain way.

He's currently shopping for a new truck/SUV. The other night, he talked to his brother about trucks for almost an hour. Anything that needs to be fixed, he'll read up on it if needed, but usually already knows how to do the repairs. But if he doesn't want to do it himself, it likely won't ever get done (unless necessary) because he doesn't trust anybody else to do the job right.",0
It's a single mindedness that is not limited. It's a strange thing and quirk but it's not harmful. It part of your love too no doubt. So cool too but I understand the frustration!,0
"The mansplaining helps to keep other women away ?? and I'm glad he's so thorough, but thinks he's immune to emotional decisions- far from it! ??",0
"Thoroughly enjoyed reading this, thanks for sharing! Neat how he wrote about ocean systems and still there was a parallel with what you do as an in home care nurse. 

Also! I live with my MIL who has an in care nurse, who is also a huge science nerd. That's funny, there's gotta be a connection there. Her hobby is growing vegetables to perfection. Her set up is wild lol",0
Yeah my SIL and BIL both have doctorates in different scientific fields and they both will complain about how little they understand. It's nuts being around people that smart.,0
"The interesting thing about smart people is that they are very aware that they know a lot, but they acknowledge they can't know everything.

The interesting thing about unintelligent people is that they know everything.",0
"My dads best friend was a Mensa member, and worked for the DoD. Dude was a trip. It was so wild watching him be so bored with complex equations. He passed away a couple years ago to cancer and we miss him a lot.",0
"To paraphrase the late Adam West, 
""i didn't need to tell people i was a genius, i talked and they knew i was a genius""",0
"He's a narcissistic dunning kruger sociopath. 

Not all stupid people think they are smart right? That requires narcissism?",0
Doesnt Dunning-Kruger need you to actually be good at something (that then makes you think youre good at everything)?,0
No that's Ultracrepidarianism. Although I belief there is a simpler term for it.,0
Ah. Thanks,0

Oh, Ron.",0
Im friends with Merlin Olsen. He comes over sometimes.,0
People that loudly proclaim their wealth or intelligence are usually lacking in both.,0
"Makes me wonder how much his dad put him down when he was young. He was a tremendous asshole. Donald himself brow beats his kids pretty heavily, calling them stupid. Not sure about Ivanka though. Weird dynamic there.",0
He's for sure never once thought about Ivanka's IQ,0
"I worked with a guy like that. Worst human Ive ever met in a professional setting. Im certain that he came home every day from grade school after being beat up by the school bully. As he cried while walking in the house his dad would ask, WTF are you crying for? And hed reply I got beat up again by the bully. He said I was fat and ugly! To which his father would have said well then, you clearly deserved the beating because you fit that description perfectly!",0
"It usually goes the other direction in my experience. I have a friend who is a mensa member and he is the most humble person I know. Slightly self deprecating at times, too. He is an extreme example, but the point is that actual genius' don't need to convince anyone. It's pretty apparent when talking to them.",0
"It's not amazing. Donald Trump is *incredibly* insecure. That may be the only category in which he actually is exceptional, as he's not just saying these affirmations for the audience, he's telling himself like a demented Stuart Smalley. 

Trump is delusional, but even delusional people notice when other people react to their statements with incredulity. He's seen it from doctors, generals, advisors, and everyone. Those looks of disbelief, disgust, and disapproval are what drive his constant need for validation.",0
"I need to thank you..You just said what my brain thinks. Except when I say it, all that comes out is, "" Trump is an insecure, ego driven idiot"". You added the manipulative aspect (validation) in a way that makes total sense now . The missing puzzle piece for me: Affirmations ??.",0
We have those studies...but they are typically on inmates and inpatients,0
So they're applicable here.,0
"He will be a case study for years to come, once this country has realized that half its population lost their collective minds by supporting someone who would be clinically diagnosed with a mental disorder if he was literally any other person whose name wasnt Trump.",0
There will be. I dont doubt some are under way as we speak,0
"Musk trained an army of ass holes to tell everyone he is a genius.

Don't know if that is worse or better. XD",0
Id say its about the same number of people who brag about passing a cognitive testWith flying colors,0
"The only time I ever see people calling themselves a genius are when they're being deeply sarcastic, or random moments of actual minor brilliance",0
"For decades and decades. Unless he wins, then there will be no studies. Of anything",0
People who are awesome at anything so not brag about it. They'll actually talk down their abilities. Other people brag about how awesome they are. Narcissists who are fucking retarded and terrible at things will always brag about how awesome they are.,0
"And a stable one, at that. Bwahahaha!!!",1
Give it about 15 years.,0
"You can apply that to almost anything. Examples include, ""Im a good person,"" ""I'm a nice person,"" ""I'm a smart person."" Typically if you have to proclaim you are XXXXXX to someone, it's usually because your actions indicate you're the exact opposite.",0
"Just for the record, anyone who has to explain the ways in which they are x are usually not - a true master doesnt have to assert thier achievements, others do it for them.",0

"Its textbook narcissistic personality disorder. Its not new. Hes an archetypal villain as old as time.


The DSM-5 code for narcissistic personality disorder is 301.81 (F60.81). 

Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a personality disorder thats characterized by a persistent pattern of grandiosity, lack of empathy, and a need for admiration. Some of the clinical features of NPD include: 

Having a grandiose sense of self-importance 

Exaggerating achievements and talents 

Expecting to be recognized as superior 

Being preoccupied with fantasies of success, power, beauty, and idealization 

Having a sense of entitlement 

Being interpersonally exploitative 

Lacking empathy 

Being envious of others 

Showing arrogant or haughty behaviors",0
He is even rambling when responding to the rambling accusations!!,0
I feel like hes setting himself up to claim insanity so he can stay out of jail when he loses the election. Throw a straight jacket on the guy Nov 6 and get the soft walled room ready.,0
"Dude has one move; stay on the offensive.

The dumber his shit is the more he *needs* to claim insane levels of intelligence.

It works too.

Hows the conversation about nation wide racism with conservatives going? Oh, it got derailed to argue about if immigrants are *actually* eating cats or not? We got tricked into arguing about stupid conspiracy theories instead of the underlying racism *AGAIN ?*

They only have one move and it has no nuance and they use it because it works and the left always falls for it, lest they be accused of ever arguing in bad faith",0
There are! And there will be so many more about the magat phenomenon.,0
And what if the studies showed that he was actually the geniusest of them all by big number? By sig figs?!,1
"Ya but during one of his verbal diarrhea ramblings he said us in a sentence. Then proceeded to say how that also is U.S.
That he was the only one to think of that, nobody had come up with that before.
And you dont think hes a genius.",1
"How would you fix the economy? as you know I grew up middle class, the folks in my neighborhood loved their lawns atleast the man explains what he will enact unlike the other",1

"When he dies, they need to dissect his brain down to the neuron and see precisely what is wrong with him, aside from the McDonalds and Alzheimers.",0
"Technically speaking, anyone with 130 or higher is a genius. I have about 200 friends on FB. So statistically, I know 4 geniuses. Exactly 0 of them have ever claimed that status.",0

"There sort of are. 

Watch #Unfit on Prime and you'll see some of the greatest mines in Psychology way in about their opinions on the orange wet fart.

"There's an interesting dynamic at play. The far right who have hitched their wagon to him have actual (deranged) beliefs, but Trump only believes in Trump.

The idea of a ""great leader"" who ""embodies the nation"" is core to their flavor of authoritarian nationalism. They've gone all in that he can be their fuhrer, but he doesn't give the tiniest shit about them or their ideals beyond how it can serve him.

They keep twisting their values to suit his whims. And now that the dementia is ramping up, their pretzeling is all the more tortured.",0

She also looks like 6 people are arguing for control to operate her face remotely.,1

"I cant stand this guy, and Im not here to insult him or his party. But has anyone done a MOCA test on him? So much of what he says reminds me of my own father AFTER he was diagnosed with dementia.

He'll take even another test, if asked. He'll take it right now. But he hasn't been asked to take another test. They said he didn't need to take another test, because anyone who scored THAT HIGH on a test, doesn't need to take another test. So he doesn't understand what people keep talking about tests. It's incredible. They were amazed. They really were.",1

4 more years of dementia...... I think Americans finally learned to stop voting for old people,0
Im afraid that theyve just learned to stop voting instead,0
Oof.. I feel like you're referring to me.,0
"How did he get to his status now, with him rambling and spouting nonsense like this? This really is a mystery.",0
"He was willing to say and do whatever his richest peers wanted of him. It is simply massive amounts of money combined with absolutely no ethics, backed by evil billionaires to get what they want.

That is the only reason.",0
"Nah, I wish it were that simple. Truth is, it's not the rich. It's working class whites. They connect with what they perceive to be0 realness, ridiculous as it sounds. 

His biggest advantage in politics is that he is so obviously not a politician. There's a massive section of the country that legitimately does not care about policies. They just don't trust any career politicians. Then along comes Trump, a man that a person who doesn't know a lot really only knows for being rich and famous. 

He comes out and runs his mouth, shooting from the hip on literally everything, regardless of how well versed he is or is not on the topic. This should and does turn off most educated people, who can quickly discern that he's just your typical 80s sleezeball businessman BSing he way through things. Problem is: a huge chunk of working class America is NOT well educated. So they see and hear all this and say ""this guy isn't a phony like the others"" because they perceive political speak as disingenuous. 

So, even though truthfully he's the biggest bullshitter of them all, to the less educated, he appears on the surface to be more genuine because he lacks political polish. His ignorance, his overt misogyny, and his slightly less overt racism in this weird way actually works for him because people think, ""No politician talks like this. He must be different!"" When in reality, he is different... but not in the way they think... he's not like the others in a very, very bad way. It's the kind of different that's legitimately dangerous. They don't see that. They just see someone not like the others and foolishly assume that must be a good thing.",0
"Way over thinking it. Those are the victims being tricked into votes. 

He's THERE because of money and influential rich people. It's what all his policies and backers are based on. 

What the uneducated fail to realize is a secondary symptom here.",0
"Nope. You misremember. He was actually frozen out by most of the top GOP donors early on. It wasn't until later the elites began to back him. Like it or not, his popularity growth was fairly natural.",0
The Mercers were heavily involved in creating the entire campaign.,0
the american education system is a joke. These dudes are literally banning books. It's insane dude this country is fucked up,0
Ban books! Not guns!,1
There's an entire right wing propaganda machine that cleans up his statements before reinforcing/programming them to his rabid base every night combined with a cult like following incapable of questioning what they've been conditioned to believe which is culled from a population that tend to believe in religion which fundamentally requires you to simply believe things just because it's expected of you or else you're ostracized from the group combined with 30+ years of right wing propaganda conditioning this same gullible group that the other side are actual devils and everything they say is evil incarnate and to blindly vote for the right wing because they must be the good ones by comparison on top of their general hatred for the fundamentals of the freedom that makes up the United States coupled with the exploitation of the fact right leaning people tend to base their identities on fear and power which sets them up perfectly to support fascism. Plus they're racist as shit and so is he.,1
Pejoratively speaking... a 'Useful Idiot'.,1
southern strategy,0
"You can see her slowly dying inside....just like everyone who shills for that fraud

![gif](giphy|gVXdwG5Ps5sIjunskA|downsized)",0
Who is he looking at? She turned sour as soon as she sees him looking at someone and then at the end he does a creepy ass tongue bite as she turns away disgusted.,0
His daughter maybe?,1
Dementia Patient on the loose,0
He is going to miss out on the applesauce! Complete with a cartoon movie.,1
Whats worse is Matlock comes on first. His afternoon is ruined!,1
[deleted],0
"[MaaaaatLoooooock!!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=W99APLlpBnY)

I grew up watching old timey shows and was a huge Andy fan. I even watched Matlock as a kiddo.

The Matlock reference is from an older gag on the Simpsons.",0
Thanks!,0
He's literally weaponized dementia lol,0

The fucks this obsession with Hannibal Lecter? He does know its a fictional character doesnt he?,0
"Best guess is that he hears immigrants are seeking ""asylum"" and he thinks that word means ""insane asylum"" and that's where the Hannibal Lector comments are from. He believes immigrants from insane asylums in Mexico are coming here to join our insane asylums",0
Definitely. Had one of these dipshits complaining about our tax dollars building all these asylums for the immigrants to live in. Im still not sure if its homegrown stupidity or propaganda coming from trolls whose first language isnt English. ,0
"I wish someone would ask him outright to explain what the connection was to Hannibal Lecter, just really make him spell it out out loud. 

Why he gets away with spouting this shit and everyone is just so worn down that they dont ever question him on this shit, is beyond me. 

He literally says so much crazy shit that you cant even keep track, and because there is so much bullshit and no one wants to deal with it, especially knowing that if questioned he will just lash out and change the subject, he gets away with it. 

Im so fucking sick of it.",0
"Yeah. In his world ""asylum seeker"" = immigrant seeking mental asylum.",0
Followed up by its genius. Can't make the shit up,0
"It's not even a guess, listen to the video and he ""explains"" just that. in a word salad of absolute drivel.

""I'm using that as an example of *people that are coming in from* **silence of the lambs**... I use it, they say 'it's terrible' so they say so I'll give this loooong complex area for instance that I talked about a lot of different territory. The bottom line is I said the most important thing 'we're bringing more plants into your state and this country to make automobiles.' "" :|

yep, that entire thought process tracks....",0
"We need to feed him some bullshit. All jokes aside, start a truth social account and get a history of spewing right wing hate...

Then eventually start commenting about ""Hannibal Lecter"", the Mexican immigrant who ate American victims. Name a few of them, etc.

Watch the day he confidently states that Hannibal was an illegal immigrant that ate his way to the US.",0
"This is seriously right wing media right now. Any random, nutcase can post some some political nonsense on social media and, next thing you know, Trump, FOX News, and MAGA are spreading it like it's real news and using it has their talking points.",0
"This is honestly what is actually happening. 

Just look at the Haitian thing. JD Vance basically admitted that this was a baseless rumor. They dont even try to spin stories anymore, they create them out of nowhere routinely.",0
"Or if truth social has that verification check like on X, have someone create a very convincing Hannibal Lector account that interacts with Trump. Then use those Deepfake videos to gaslight him into thinking Lector attended his rallies and fundraisers. I'm sure eventually he'll start believing he's a real person that was a major contributor to his campaign. 

Trump: Seriously people, I gotta thank my good friend Hannibal Lector. If it wasn't for the good Dr, I'm not sure I'd be here. He's been with me every step of the way.",0
He is more like Miggs...,0
Ozempic face,0
Shell always be the Mucinex? booger to me.,0
I think she was the model for the booger.,1
"No, shes a Picasso painting.and a booger.",1
"She sucks, but absolutely not cool to be shitty to everyone who has lost weight and might be insecure about it. ",0
"My girls been mewing, shes almost smashable if you look from the profile view",1
Lmao. I can't fix her. That's you dawg,0
How old is she? I thought she was 50+.,0
"Sarah Huckabee Sanders is **42**.

[o_O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Huckabee_Sanders)",0
You can tell her age by counting her neck rings when she looks down.,1
Im 45 and I dont have a quintuple chinyet,0
"Shit, thats a double quintuple with cheese",0
Holy shit. Were the same age?! I always thought she was *much* older than me. ??,0
42,0
A love how republicans say Kamala slept her way to the top but vote for Sanders who clearly should not be in her current position.,0
This comment just happens to be directly under a gif of Bernie Sanders and I was so confused.,0
??,0
Maybe she slept her way to the top? Incest seems to be a feature for some republicans. Sorry for the visual.,0
??,0
That enbred bitch is just as dumb as drumpf,0
"So we are just going to pretend that this spectacular idiot is just fit to be president. Are we really so out of mediocre white men that we have to settle for this as a choice with one of our political parties? Is there no one who can formulate a non coked up thought? 

Who thinks this moron is brilliant?",0
"""It's not rambling,"" he rambled.",0
"Fuck Huckabee too. All these people know he's batshit crazy and just go along with his lunacy, only because they share the same hateful, selfish, un-American views.",0
Fuckabee.,0
![gif](giphy|4ce1TjDI7lSs1IiNOe|downsized),0
This guy is a freaking idiot.,0
"Trump is mentally ill. A textbook narcissistic. Plain as day. As much as I despise him, I can forgive him for that. I truly pity him deep down. 

However the people giving him a platform and supporting him, the Sarah Huckabees of the world, truly what is their excuse? 

There are plenty of traitors, crazies, fascists that reside in the United States. The only difference between one yelling at the sky and one actively being able to implement their policies and views are those people.",0
She sold her soul to the devil. There is a cost.,0
"Hes not the devil lol. He was already President, and life was better",0
"Wow. If she had any self respect she would wish these recordings to never be seen, by anyone. You can literally see how much she hates herself.",0
"This is what she sold her soul for. A babbling buffoon. 

Was it worth it Sarah? Life is long. Shame is hard to wash off.",0
"If you cant explain it simply, you dont understand it well enough.

-Albert Einstein",0
I need the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme to start as they start zooming in,0
And somehow his fans are able to call this behavior something other than demented,0
"Hey Sarah, it's hard to smile thru that ?? ??. isn't it?",0
"Someone needs to tell him that he can't draw a clock, to trick him into testing himself for dementia. ",0
Somehow hed figure out a way to convince himself that 1 + 1 = 3,1
She reaps what she sows.,0
Yet she still licks his taint.,0
"Dementia, word salad and narcissistic personality disorder, got all the bases covered.",0
How is the crowd applauding this madness?,0
I wonder if she ate the horse that kicked her in the face. Seems like the type to eat a horse,0
Thinking about how shes going to have to sell this shit as intelligent lol.,0
Her smile is upside down. Geez Arkansas. You really know how to pick a winner,1
We've seen all these expressions on Huckabee Sanders' face before (when she has a shame faced right wing o'shizm. Usually while talk8ng to the press about children in cages.),0
Its a shame that his kids wont save him from himself. I mean FFS. Put that man in a home or something.,0
She can probably smell his diaper too. Also heard his body odor is so bad its gag wrenching. Hes a senile old riddled dementia nursing home runaway.,0
"She was so cringed out she tried to pop her head inside her body like a tortoise, but she failed",0
Those are the expressions you make when your soul is escaping from your body.,0
That pig already sold her soul,0
"Her facial expressions!??

![gif](giphy|nmKBaZgcH8h20sQQI2)",0
"She's like, ""Everything's fine! Just humor him, please.""",0
So how does Hannibal Lecter fit in all of this again? Im still confused,0
That's Trump's spirit character.,0
Shes dying inside. Rightfully so.,0
She is complicit. Fuck her.,0
He's a Dr Evil kind of genius,1
"Id love to hear what shes really thinking cuz her expressions are giving, Omg Im so horrified",0
"If republican women could talk, oh the tales they would tale!",0
Fucking guy is rambling while trying to explain he doesn't ramble.,0
Thats the expression of someone being smacked dead in the face with the realization theyve sold any shred of dignity they may have had for an incompetent geriatric who cant form a coherent thought let alone run the country. Will she do anything about it? Of course not. These people dont care about anything beyond their own bottom line.,0
"I wouldnt bother anthropomorphizing her. If she were human, she might have some sort of self reflection in the moment. But insects dont self reflect. The facial expressions are just those of a skin walker trying to stop the poorly fitting mask from sliding off.",0
"The deeply engrained, fathomless depths of her dead-eyed ""yes dear"" smile, barely covering the silent scream by the rest of her body is just the saddest bit of patriarchy I've watched in a long time. Just yikes.",0
"She is just as vile as he is, so they deserve one another.",0
"Flint, Michigan cant seem to catch a break. This damn fool comes to Flint, MI and vomits this word salad. ??",0
That and she's probably smelling him,0
"She hates her life right now, ??",0
Thats a rambling...,0
"Trump is clearly a genius - because he keeps on saying so himself.

I wonder how many other geniuses refer to their own state of genius?",1
"He wouldn't pass the most basic Job interview, for ANY Job.",0
All the ozempic in the world couldn't rid SH of those chins,0
You noticed that too huh? It gave me shivers down my spine,0
Shes so cringe ??,0
![gif](giphy|xT9DPtO6zTqeQd1ct2),0
??????,0
Republicans are definitely planning on ganking him if hes elected. Theyre actually voting for Vance one 2025. Thats why the republicans have been doing the attempts,0
she knows she and he are frauds,0
They all despise him but have sold their souls. ,0
Ugliest woman on the planet,0
Inside and out,0
"But shes still going to vote for him, and still going to campaign for him",0
[What have I done],0
Is it just me or is this audio for ants?,0
more like fleas. i was like. am i losing my hearing?,0
This can't be real if it is .. he needs a dr,0
He's a genius in his own head to the rest of us he's a prat,0
"Right off the top he rambles about a movie.

Says something about importing car plants.

No thats not rambling, thats che-nius

And hes STILL in contention to be POTUS ??",0
"Isn't that Huckabee-Sanders? She used to pretend to respect him when she was Press Secretary. Now she's throwing him to the wolves.

Can't stand the guy myself, but I can't stand a hypocrite like SHS either.",0
She clearly looks uncomfortable and stupified.,0
Even Sarah just like jeez not the Hannibal shit again,0
"If shes there, whos scaring our crows?",1
What in the word salad did he just say?,0
Genianus,0
"Sarah's neck is melting down into her chest, she needs to just get that loose skin cut off already.",0
The look of someone who knows theyve sold their soul,0
Are we sure thats just not how her face is?,0
Her turkey neck is crazy!!,0
Sarah Huckabee is that one girl in every Southern sorority. You know the one.,0
Shes a qunt. With smoky eyes.,0
"Thats not rambling, thats genius! 

Spoken like someone with a firm grasp on reality/s.",1
"That's not wandering, that's genius. SMH. No sir, that's dementia with delusions of grandeur.",1
Remember when she was the press secretary and then just kind of dipped out? yeah. I dont know why anybody would vote for her. Another alternate facts dumbass liar.,0
"Nah, she's just trying not to poop her pants from all the Ozembic ??",1
Its a face of someones ethics dying,0
Was this recent??? That's bad when it comes to basic human capabilities. Everyone has to see that. (not American btw),0
"Ill give this long, complex area??? Wtf? His brain is mush.",0
"He needs to step down, like BIDEN!!!",0
"Wait but can we talk about the subtitles autocorrecting Hannibal Lecter to Hannah Belekter? Im dying, thats got to be a drag queen name.",0
She found the Ozempic huh?,0
"Yeah, but all her loose skin just hangs around.",0
This snake cant shed so easy huh?,0
The dialogue sounds like it's coming from a new character invented by Sacha Baron Cohen or some other similarly effective piss-taking character comedian.,0
"Next time I get hammered and my wife tells me to stop explaining how my terrible fantasy football decisions are going to work out next weekend, Im dropping the Its not rambling, its genius line on her lol!",1
It's actually scary though that a man this senile and angry has so much power and money. If no from his party is stepping up to stop him now then they aren't going to do it if he wins the election and becomes president again.,0
Sarah Sanders looks like every body part she has is trying to escape being Sarah Sanders.,0
"Google William Kelly, Wharton Professor.said Trump was the dumbest god damn student Ive ever had.",0
These Jesus-freak evangelical hypocrites deserve to be shamed for a hundred years or more for rallying around this pornographic criminal.,0
I want a lip reader to tell me what she says to herself at around 35-36 seconds.,0
Hasnt she always made those kind of faces though? Forced smiles and acting as if shes paying attention.,0
What can I overspend on to hide my next trip.,0
He answers questions. Just not the ones hes asked ??,0
The Neck at .23,0
"Thats not rambling, its genius was just icing on the dementia cake",0
"Cue the ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" theme.",0
He's had a containment breach sitting down and she smells it.,0
"And her responses to him were like placating a child. She had to reassure him after his rambling that he wasnt rambling. Watch the town hall in Detroit with the AR gov, ugh. She is a POS",0
Hannibal Lector is obviously Trump's hero.,0
I hate you for making me look at her face.,0
"Dear God how, how, how does anyone think this man should be president?! WTF is wrong with you half of the U.S.?!?!",0
He managed to make her eyes go even more crazy,0
She looks like a Hostage ?? Blink twice if you wish daddy was a Democrat!! ????,0

Thats just her face. Her hate makes it weird,0
Ill give this long complex area.,0

Is that the pig from Arkansas? Shes clearly been on the Ozempic train huh? Lol,0
I feel like this was a trick to get people to look at her face. Shudder,0
He's definitely redefining genius. It will not be long before the word will no longer will be used.,0
Maybe she's itchy.,0
"Get fucked, people were saying the same damn thing about Biden and his ass still got elected",0
"People cant hide their true feelings in their expressions. The gross part is she wont just tell the fucking truth. She thinks hes as big a douche bag liar as the rest of us do. Its LITERALLY written all over her face. I Iove that expression because its always true.

"I dont think people understand just how carefully curated the image of a president is. They often use statistics and focus groups to find just the right things to say to get the most supporters, whether or not they actually believe it is a different story. Interviews with the president are only approved if the questions the interviewer can ask are carefully selected. Thats why I think Trump is probably the most honest president weve gotten is recent times, he gets to be openly racist.

Damn fr these comments are mean as f.,0
Hes soooooooo old. So freakin old.,0
Jeez this is impossible to follow.,0
And this is why you need to vote every Republican out. The bootlickers in the GOP are even worse than Trump because they 100% know what's up. If not Trump they'll move on to the next fascist in line.,0
What you see are the facial expressions of cognitive dissonance,0
She always looks like that. Even when she was the Press Secretary.,0
"He promised so many jobs in his last presidency and everyone flopped. There was a car manufacturer in Ohio he boasted about, shut down. Michigan had a plant too. Shut down.",0
She looks like she's sitting next to ole' Rudy while he's in court ranting about the stolen election after a Taco Bell run.,0

We can disagree on one topic but the other is scientific fact. Theres no difference between sex and gender and if one of you out there think thats wrong then.. and not follow science . I hope this man is a threat to democracy and communism. In America we are a constitutional republic, and those are two hardcore facts for the rockies out there. Sex Gender same thing and theres only two choices, America is not a democracy. Facts. Trump being great, my opinion.

He does have a point. Those people coming in from the silence of the lambs have to be dealt with. Them and their aggressively silent lambs.,1

Did hillary get a group of crazy mad people to go abs and hang mike pence no she didn't.,0
">> Hillary is still saying she was robbed in 2016,

Hillary hasnt spent years saying it was (thoroughly debunked) illegal voting that lost her the election. She didnt call state officials in Georgia and tell them to make up votes for her. She didnt help stage a coup to prevent the peaceful transfer of power and upend democracy as we know it. 

>> Kamala recd zero (0) votes in the 2021 primary

There was no primary in 2021 that Kamala was a part of. She was vice president in 2021. 

>> two assassination attempts on Trump

That have been condemned by democrats

>> hi-ranking FBI agents worked to defeat Trump

First of all, high*-ranking. 

Second, this didnt happen. What you might be thinking of is James Comey announcing reopening the investigation into Hillary Clintons emails less than two weeks before the 2016 election, which undeniably had an impact of some degree on voters. She lost fair and square (as did Trump in 2020), but that absolutely had an effect. 

>> etc. etc.

Kinda ran out of steam there at the end, huh?",0
"Nope, didnt run out of steam at all. 

There can be no doubt there was an organized coup to oust Biden from the 2024 election. 

While I cant remember their names at the moment, the 2 lovebird FBI employees that were caught red handed via text messages planning on obstructing Trumps 2016 election is undeniable. They were not low level FBI people.

Comeys actions were done to clear Hillary before her expected 2016 win. Done so they could say she god been investigated & cleared by FBI. Thank God she lost.and in a spectacular fashion.

(Edited for spelling)",0

You are all cringing at Trump talking about bringing work back to America but Kamala Drunk actually rambling on Oprah is A ok! ??,1
"He's *always* talking about that kind of plans he has for this or that. He was already very clear that he had plans to save people jobs at several companies, notably in the oil and car industry, not to mention to make Mexico pay for the wall, or recently to end the War in Ukraine.

Here's the thing however. He never shares his supposed somehow always secret plans which are almost certainly imaginary and non existent, the rare times where he does it's an absolute joke that shows he has no clue what he's talking about and it doesn't even qualify as a plan, and either way, he somehow manages to get no results lmao. At best he gives some shitty childish excuse for why his plan didn't work, which is never his fault.

His plans to save people's jobs? Those people lost their jobs. His plans to make Mexico pay for the wall? Mexico didn't pay for the wall. His secret plans to end the War in Afghanistan within days of becoming president? The war kept going, and when asked later on, he said his plan was too cruel and he was too kind lmao. His secret plan now to end the war in Ukraine? Nobody knows, everybody guesses it's just submitting to Putin, but i'm gonna bet his so very secret plan which he somehow absolutely can't reveal until he hets elected for some very mysterious reason is not gonna happen either.

Fuck, i can make a secret plan right now to unite every country and bring prosperity to all and peace on earth and everyone will have a job and a house. It will take effect three days after i become president. No, nobody else can do it, and i can't tell you what the plan is.

I don't give a shit if either of them gets drunk on Oprah or in some bar or at home or wherever, as long as they're not full of shit.",0
"Now suddenly he is senile, and everyone was playing dumb pretending Joe the Potato was not senile?

Pathetic clowns",0
"Whos pretending Joe isnt senile? He definitely is, but with how often trump opens his mouth while spouting out ten lies a minute, hes probably gone senile too.",0
Trump was lying way before being senile,0
"Yeah, i feel like its just gotten more obvious now. Hes slipped up and made himself into a much bigger fool than usual by falling for the cat eating lie and such.",0
"The LEFT. 

For 3.5 years he wasnt. Until the media told people it was OK to think he was senile and then suddenly he was senile",0
"Joe always was the better option of two bad options. I, and my friends, who are all on the left, regularly made fun of Joe biden, but he was still LEAGUES better than Trump.",0
So you're just gonna pretend you didn't see this clip or any of the countless others over the last few months of this rambling nonsense about a fictional character? Tell me what he was talking about in this clip please?,0
"They're both senile. Trump isn't suddenly senile. He's been declining for years. Of the two, Biden would have been surrounded by competent bureaucrats who I'm confident would not end democracy if he got re-elected. I wasn't excited to vote for Biden, but between the two declining ~80 year olds he was clearly the better option.

When it became clear he couldn't handle another 4 years, Democrats applied pressure to get him to step aside. And he did a remarkable thing. He put the needs of the country over his own ego and threw his support behind Kamala. The GOP could have done that too. But they didn't. And Trump would never put the needs of the country over his own.

Joe isn't running anymore. There's only one senile old man in the race. So there's only one senile old man who is worth talking about at this point.",0
I really hope the left isnt trying to claim senile after the last 3 fucking years of someones grandfather that should be in a home being in office,0
Trump is obviously in cognitive decline.,0
Biden hasnt been able to form a sentence since he was sworn in,0
"And Trump can't form sentences now. 

You're not going to avoid the fact that Trump is obviously in mental decline by deflecting to Biden, who isn't running again.",0
Ima deflect as much as I want to cuz Trump misspelled coffee once and looked at the eclipse like a goober and got dragged about it all over the place but Biden constantly topples over and basically needs a leash for four years and everyones is like :) yeah but that other guy is banned off twitter,0
You're embarrassing yourself.,0
"Ooooooooops

Idc. Know what I miss? Affording groceries 

If Kamala can make living comfortable be a thing again cool. 

If Trump does. Cool

I give a fuck which side is in office but I am pretty sick of the left acting like Biden wasnt embarassing as hell for his entire term 


Wait wait wait. He did get hit with hard hitting questions like what type of ice cream he got

Chocolate chocolate chip :D",0
"What's Trump's plan to reduce the cost of groceries? 

Nothing. 
He doesnt have one. 

Get a fucking grip dude, Trump getting elected wouldn't magically improve your life.",0
"All I know is life was peachy when me and my ex rented a house for cheap back in 2017. Bought a house together 2019. Broke up and I was able to buy a house by myself in 2020. Was ahead of bills lived comfy as hell and next thing I knew I had to pick and choose which bill to ignore for the month. 

And Im sorry thats not a coincidence 

Its not just groceries its electric, gas, why did my internet bill go from $80 when I got my house to $130? 

The cost of living is fucking crap and you cant deny that. Theres no way you can unless you make six figures then youre chillin 


I make the same exact amount per hour as I did in 2020 but Im struggling harder than I ever have today. 

Shame on my employer for not matching the cost of living but the bosses are buying Escalades n shit. But I digress 


All I want dude is to afford what I got as a middle class working man 

Again. I was chillin 2020. What the fuck",0
"The cost of living crisis is caused by corporate greed, not a magic lever in the oval office. 

If you think Trump and Republicans are going to do anything to reduce the funneling from money from the working class into the pockets of big business then pass the fucking blunt. 

Again, Trump being elected wouldn't magically improve your life. 

Get a grip.",0
"And again Kamala has technically been in office the entire time life has sucked. 

So her being elected wont magically improve shit either. 

The whole thing fucking sucks and I hate it.

also, get a grip? 

The only people I know that doesnt have a grip are the ones that dont remember how fucking easy it was to live 2016-2021

I know so many people that are like Ive never voted before but Im voting this year

2020 you know which side someone landed on when they are like go vote! ?? its so important to go vote omg

Now its the opposite.",0
"You have to be a special kind of person to think Trump will magically make everything affordable for you. 

How will he do it? 
You don't know and you don't care. 

Meanwhile Harris has a plan to cap grocery price increases, the GOP calls it communism. 

You're embarrassing yourself by correlating ""Trump in office"" with ""I could afford shit"" when the reason you can't afford anything today is because corporate greed during the pandemic jacked the price of EVERYTHING up. 

For suck sake, look at the profits of every major business over the last 4 years and see they have increased exponentially while wages stagnated. 

Corporate greed is why cost of living is so bad. 

For the last time, get a fucking grip.",0
"Funny enough the left were the ones that so badly wanted the planet to shut down cuz of the flu which is what fucked everything up. Trump was out of office 2020. Height of the pandemic was 2021. HM

Why hasnt Biden and Harris capped the grocery prices four years ago? 

Again again the left is like stay home save a life. Billionaires suck rarara but also pay Amazon more and more. 

Real strange how billionaires doubled their net worth during the pandemic while the rest of us have been suffering but OMG ROE V WADE

you look at your receipts for the last 10 years look at what was affordable and then tell yourself to get a grip 

I made my mind up when I went to buy a pack of cheese and a pack of ham and I was asked to bounty up $17 about it.


The amount of family owned businesses that had to close cuz of the fuck ass pandemic is depressing. Meanwhile big chains thrived. 


Politicians were constantly caught not following their own fucking rules about it. 

Everything was cool years ago. Everything sucks now. Im not embarrassing myself saying that 

I vividly remember paying $1.89 a gallon in 2018. And for the last four years gas has been floating around $4 except oh wait thats wild its under $3 right before elections. Thanks Kamala! I should vote for you again",0
"Clowns like you are the reason the first lesson in Grade 9 science class is ""Correlation ? causation"". 

Because your entire reasoning is ""Trump was president and I could afford shit, therefore Trump is the reason I could afford shit!"" ??????

How did Trump make everything affordable? 
You don't know. 

How will Trump make everything affordable again? 
You don't know. 

You're an embarrassment.",0
"Ill rebuttal with why was life affordable from 2016-2021

Why hasnt life been affordable since then til now?

What will Kamala do different that Biden did?


There is no answer. I dont give a fuck if Trump is elected I just know if the same stupid cunt thats already in office stays in office Im going to have to sell my house in a year or be homeless 


Also is funny when Obama was in office gas was up near $4. What the fuck? I kinda get the president has fuck all to do with that but its awfully coincidental huh? 

Whoever makes life affordable again gets my vote. Im not an embarrassment for that

And again I dont know anyone that has had to pay bills for the last 4 years that want another 4 years of this bullshit 


The only ones that wanna vote Kamala that I know live at home and are too worried about abortion",0
I could see her running for VP or President someday. Not that she has my vote.,0
Love you Trump!! God bless you and your family!!,1
"Thats no rambling, Thats genius",1
Who gives a shit how she feels about it? Fuck off. She deserves nothing.,0
"If anyone can spot a senile old candidate it isnt reddit.

Your desperation is gross at this point",0
"He rambles, hes not senile. Put up Biden and his invisible chair in France, if you want to see senility on display. Lol",0
You just watched senility on display champ.,0
"You can delude yourself, but not those of us with the ability to think critically. Lol",0
Those of us who think critically arent voting Trump. Its kinda your whole thing. Trump supporters are notoriously uneducated.,0
"He's running against Harris, genius.",0
"Whos the current president, dunce cap? Lmao",0
The video is Trump currently campaigning against Harris. No one is voting for Biden this election. So your point is useless.,0
"The topic of the current president and his mental decline is the point, dreg. Thank god that trump is unburdened by what has been. Hahaha!!",0
"That's not the topic, dummy.",0
It absolutely is the topic of my comment thread.,0
"So, you brought up Biden as a whataboutism and you're sticking to it. Good job buddy.",0
"Oh, so you're a Kamala supporter? You want Biden to step down so Kamala can take his place in the oval office even sooner. I like your thinking, I'm with you brother let's make it happen.",1
"Why? Biden isnt running? We didnt want a grossly old candidate and he made the right decision to drop out. Trump is the only old man now. Did any of what he said sound coherent to you? His stream of consciousness speech? 

Biden absolutely had mental decline at his age but he was just more coherent than Trump.",0
"Whos the current president, my trisomic friend?",1
But he isnt running against Trump so why bring up Biden? Seems irrelevant to the conversation since Biden is retiring in 4 months.,0
Kamala is better than a fuckin convict lol,0
"We all forgot that Biden did the same thing, and people still cheered. It's all just ""sports fans' politics""",0
Its amazing u Morons are u ok with loving an old deranged chomo like Biden and his sidekick the goofy Kamala. Tell us what trump is what he is but I liked the country a hell of a lot more when he was running it. But Covid was the plan to remove him and yup u sure love what we have now. Freaking expensive everything,0
"So what was it? The chaos? His weather reporting skills? His ideas on sanitizing the human body? 

Oh! You're going to say the economy....

Oh! The really good one he inherited from Obama and then destroyed?",0
Sounds normal to me ?????,0
"You're right, it does sound like Trump's normal incoherent babbling.",0
"Yeah not fan either but definitely wont be voting Harris and walz, walz alone is why I wont voting for them. Harris wont answer any questions about her policies besides trying to implement similar things California has done and tried. California is doing so well /s all she does goes into rambling about her so called middle class growing up which is proven BS she went to private school. She faked her accent when she goes to a white, black and Hispanic rallies. Give trump all the shit at least he doesnt hide is ego like other politicians. At least when he was office gas and groceries were affordable. It was the left that shutdown our country when he tried to keep it open. Biden and Harris has allowed this border crisis to swell so badly. Now we have South American gangs roaming cities. American citizens are getting booted for these illegals. There is that one city they cut the school buses but only to American children forcing parents to drive them or make them walk. I get it trump runs his stupid mouth at least most of his policies didnt hurt us Americans. The left caused our inflation crisis. The home buying issue no president can do anything about that. States though can cut the red tape to allow easier building thats why CA and many other state that require high permits to build is why those states cant build houses hence houses more expensive.",0
"I think Trump is much more responsive to the public and willing to actually do whatever he rambles on about. As long as it makes him popular. Obviously that means he does big promises that he cant deliver on.

On the other hand typical politicians tread much more safely, make small promises and dont even try to deliver on those.

With Trump youre simply getting exactly what you see and what he is. With Kamala youre getting a chameleon that just morphs as its beneficial.",0
Yup I agree and I see we got downvoted lol,0
You guys never stop !,0
And you guys praise Trump for every crazy thing he does,0
Gotta distract everyone from the Oprah interview.,0
The only thing leftist wont believe is the truth,0
It only took the democrats 3 1/2 years to recognize senility so obviously they are experts.,0
So many left loons,0
That was your takeaway from this video? ??,0
"Didn't watch it, but the last guy was senile for 4 yrs and no one cared",0
Why didnt you watch it? Too much for you to accept? I cared. And Trump showed signs of it his entire term as President.,0
Yea too much to handle and now I'm in here talking with you coping... let's keep spending time in here k,0
You should watch it. Just be honest with yourself. Hes burnt. And you cant even watch. Its clear you are trying to sideline the truth. ??,0
You sound like a creepy drug dealer.,0
You sound moronic. When did I mention drugs?,0
"It was a joke lol. You didnt mention drugs. It was just funny cause your post posted twice, so it was like come on man try it, watch it, just try it. Sorry ???????",0
"Jordan Klepper's videos of utter dipshits at Trump rallies, there is no conservative version of that.",0
It's the radical right!! You guys are insane,0
"Yea, so radical, so bodacious, so demure",0
You wanted to hang Mike pence for Donald Trump lmao,0
Who are you and why aren't you at work,0
I am you fool I work from home,0
Must be a blessing for people that don't have to interact with you in person... because I can tell you suck,0
Well it must be a blessing for those that don't have to interact with in person.. because I can tell you suck,0
I do know what you do... we've been watching you make a fool of yourself for at least 2yrs now. What is a fool like you to do when AI takes your job ??,0
Lol don't try and turn this around on me we are here to talk about the new Hitler so why you on the wrong side of history then,0
So what was he actually on about in this clip?,0
