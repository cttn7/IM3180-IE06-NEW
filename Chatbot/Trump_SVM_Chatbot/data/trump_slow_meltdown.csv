Having a grandiose sense of self-importance 

Exaggerating achievements and talents 

Expecting to be recognized as superior 

Being preoccupied with fantasies of success, power, beauty, and idealization 

Having a sense of entitlement

They just don't trust any career politicians. Then along comes Trump, a man that a person who doesn't know a lot really only knows for being rich and famous. 

He comes out and runs his mouth, shooting from the hip on literally everything, regardless of how well versed he is or is not on the topic. This should and does turn off most educated people, who can quickly discern that he's just your typical 80s sleezeball businessman BSing he way through things.

So, even though truthfully he's the biggest bullshitter of them all, to the less educated, he appears on the surface to be more genuine because he lacks political polish.

>> Kamala rec’d’ zero (0) votes in the 2021 primary

There was no primary in 2021 that Kamala was a part of. She was vice president in 2021. 

>> two assassination attempts on Trump

That have been condemned by democrats

>> hi-ranking FBI agents worked to defeat Trump

First of all, high*-ranking. 

Second, this didn’t happen. What you might be thinking of is James Comey announcing reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails less than two weeks before the 2016 election, which undeniably had an impact of some degree on voters. She lost fair and square (as did Trump in 2020), but that absolutely had an effect.

Comey’s actions were done to clear Hillary before her expected 2016 win. Done so they could say she god been investigated & cleared by FBI. Thank God she lost….and in a spectacular fashion.

Here's the thing however. He never shares his supposed somehow always secret plans which are almost certainly imaginary and non existent, the rare times where he does it's an absolute joke that shows he has no clue what he's talking about and it doesn't even qualify as a plan, and either way, he somehow manages to get no results lmao. At best he gives some shitty childish excuse for why his plan didn't work, which is never his fault.

His plans to save people's jobs? Those people lost their jobs. His plans to make Mexico pay for the wall? Mexico didn't pay for the wall. His secret plans to end the War in Afghanistan within days of becoming president? The war kept going, and when asked later on, he said his plan was too cruel and he was too kind lmao. His secret plan now to end the war in Ukraine? Nobody knows, everybody guesses it's just submitting to Putin, but i'm gonna bet his so very secret plan which he somehow absolutely can't reveal until he hets elected for some very mysterious reason is not gonna happen either.

lolp0pp,loldm3r,ImJustSaying34,"Why? Biden isn’t running? We didn’t want a grossly old candidate and he made the right decision to drop out. Trump is the only old man now. Did any of what he said sound coherent to you? His stream of consciousness speech? 

Biden absolutely had mental decline at his age but he was just more coherent than Trump.",9,0,2

lomc30b,,SimplePomelo1225,It’s amazing u Morons are u ok with loving an old deranged chomo like Biden and his sidekick the goofy Kamala. Tell us what trump is what he is but I liked the country a hell of a lot more when he was running it. But Covid was the plan to remove him and yup u sure love what we have now.

looe4df,,Strict-Aspect6716,"Yeah not fan either but definitely won’t be voting Harris and walz, walz alone is why I won’t voting for them. Harris won’t answer any questions about her policies besides trying to implement similar things California has done and tried. California is doing so well /s all she does goes into rambling about her so called middle class growing up which is proven BS she went to private school. She faked her accent when she goes to a white, black and Hispanic rallies. Give trump all the shit at least he doesn’t hide is ego like other politicians. At least when he was office gas and groceries were affordable. It was the left that shutdown our country when he tried to keep it open. Biden and Harris has allowed this border crisis to swell so badly. Now we have South American gangs roaming cities. American citizens are getting booted for these illegals. There is that one city they cut the school buses but only to American children forcing parents to drive them or make them walk. I get it trump runs his stupid mouth at least most of his policies didn’t hurt us Americans. The left caused our inflation crisis. The home buying issue no president can do anything about that. States though can cut the red tape to allow easier building that’s why CA and many other state that require high permits to build is why those states can’t build houses hence houses more expensive.",-3,0,2
loohobq,looe4df,draiki13,"I think Trump is much more responsive to the public and willing to actually do whatever he rambles on about. As long as it makes him popular. Obviously that means he does big promises that he can’t deliver on.

On the other hand typical politicians tread much more safely, make small promises and don’t even try to deliver on those.

With Trump you’re simply getting exactly what you see and what he is. With Kamala you’re getting a chameleon that just morphs as it’s beneficial.",-2,0,0
