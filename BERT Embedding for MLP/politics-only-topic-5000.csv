I don't know if the President can change that. -Comparative studies among developed countries that show the police killing rate reformers believe the US should aspire to...afaik these countries all have significant structural differences from the US (less untreated mental illness and less driving per capita as well as more provisions to keep guns and even knives out of the hands of troubled individuals). It might be possible that most US police killings are necessary and would occur in France or Canada under the same circumstances; it's just that those circumstances don't happen there as much as there's less driving, meaning less traffic stops and less concern about unarmed suspects squishing cops with 2 tons machinery, as well as better healthcare and better background checks for guns."

Consider this: Trump has a political incentive to adopt a firm protectionist stance, but he also has enough of an ego that he wants to be able to point to the country and say ""No-one is better at the presidency than me"", and the impact to trade and the economy from strong protectionism threatens that. Enter the UK. He's already said he wants to put us first in line for a trade deal post-Brexit, so all we have to do is position ourselves as the gateway to the US economy. He can put in all the protections he wants, but by assuring our access, and allowing rules to be put in place that funnel goods and services through our economy to theirs (for a reasonable fee) he gives a route for companies in China etc to still trade on decent terms whilst maintaining the *appearance* of strong protectionism. It also gives him political insulation from not being strong on China, because he can just make it ""our fault"" that their effective rates are only slightly higher than they used to be, and he can defend not doing anything about it because after all, we are our own country and the special relationship is special and look at all the jobs he's creating. The numbers are increasing bigly! This then also helps with Brexit, because we can then leverage that position in our negotiations. Germany starts getting ideas about tariffs on goods? Oh look, President Trump just made an announcement outlining proposed new funding for the opening of markets in the UK for struggling American car manufacturers. France gets out of line? Oh look, President Trump has made an announcement outlining funding for increased export capacity for Californian wine producers to break into the European distribution market through ""our close partners in Britain"". I'm using idealised examples, but you get the idea. By playing the fears of the EU industrial markets against the political desires of the new President, we can manipulate the situation to our advantage. What makes it better is that if we do it right, we don't even have to hide what we're doing, because our counterparts in the EU will be powerless to stop us without ruining themselves politically. Is it cynically opportunistic? Tremendously! Is it evil? A little (hey for us that's progress!). It could work though..."

When you choose to be a civil servant, you don't represent yourself. You represent the people. It's their will, and their law, that you are enforcing. You do not elect yourself to special ""morality dispenser"" when you put yourself in her role. By NOT doing her job, she is actively harming the constituents that pay her salary. She is refusing to work, still getting paid, and enforcing her own morality on people who don't care what she thinks. Now let's jump over to our dancing friends. They don't want to perform, which harms no one. They would not be paid for the event, and they aren't enforcing their own will on anyone else. To the contrary, they simply do not want to be forced to show support of an individual that represents the opposites of their values. See how your comparison pretty much falls apart there, or are you still clinging to the idea that Kim Davis refusing to certify legal marriages is the same as these ladies refusing to dance? On a last note, I will say that the problem with the Kim Davis situation is that she was the only one who could legally certify the marriage licenses. No one in the office could do it and have it be legally binding. If there was an alternative to her signing them, then yes, I would say she would have been fully in the right to refuse the certification. But she can't use her political beliefs to fully block the marriages of legal couples that she doesn't agree with. Imagine if the Rockettes, for example, didn't just refuse to perform, but made it so NOT ONE ELSE could perform either. They said that because THEY didn't want to do it, no one else could either. Oh, and they got paid. That would be a better comparison."

How do we divide (or what do we do with) the UC system, the greatest public university system in the world? No doubt this would change immensely, and likely not for the better. How do we divide the judiciary up? California's judiciary is one of the largest judiciaries in the world (larger than the entire federal judiciary, at the very least, although I have seen different claims about who has the largest judiciary worldwide). There are so many logistical and administrative problems that make whatever national political changes it could have not worth it, even if one would prefer those national political changes. One caveat would be that dividing the Ninth Circuit (a topic on here recently) might actually become feasible at that point. I am also skeptical about dividing into 9 separate states. The Six Californias plan or the idea of bisecting the state (into a Nor-Cal and a So-Cal, sort of) seem to be the most popular, to the extent they are popular at all.

I was teaching a class of 25 students (about 20 male, all black or Hispanic) about searches and seizures, and I wanted to use the random searches they conduct in subways as a vehicle for discussion. So I asked, ""have any of you been searched by a police officer in the last year in the subway?"" All 25 of them raised their hands. Most of them stated that they had been searched multiple times, some said dozens of times in the last year. These kids were like, 13-15 years old. I have lived in New York City for three years. I am white. I have never been searched. The two white lawyers with me have never been searched, both have lived here longer. What do you think that does to a kid, to their perception of the world, and police, and their rights and their autonomy, that at 13-15 years old, that police have patted them down and gone through their backpack on the way to school, that police do that to all their friends, that it happens on a weekly or monthly basis?

0,"You cannot delineate 'free speech' into certain areas only, because by definition, it would therefore not be 'free' speech.",Rob_Kaichin,ukpolitics,12,-1,-1,2016-12,5/12/2016 17:25,"Oh, not the post-truth whining about safe spaces and trigger warnings again. Trigger warnings have got nothing to do with free speech; they're just there (in principle) to be nice and considerate to people (yes they exist) who've suffered something traumatic and can have very unpleasant experiences such as panic attacks brought on by certain evocations. It's as asinine as saying that the BBFC is against Free Speech because they note the content of movies so you can decide if your kids should watch them. Yes in certain circumstances it has gotten a bit out of hand with TWs for everything under the sun, and yes the efficacy of TWs is dubious because it's hard to predict when a stimulus will cause a flashback, but neither of these mean that Free Speech is being impeded. And safe spaces are related. There are two different notions of safe spaces you find at universities. One is about the rules at debates and conferences, and yes indeed you get stuff like ""jazz hands instead of clapping please"". But that's not to repress certain opinions, it's because some people have said it makes the conference nicer for them, for various reasons (e.g. better for those with hearing aids, more bearable for autistic people [noise], less intimidating to speakers with unpopular views). Call the requesters ""special snowflakes"" if you want, say it's ridiculous, but again, it doesn't impede free speech. It's really no skin off my back not to clap; no one was forcing me not to clap; and if it makes someone else's day more bearable then it's just about not being a dick, really. The second notion of safe space is more relevant to free speech, but I think it's still erroneous to apply it. It's saying *in some particular space or context* people with a particular worldview can expect it to be taken for granted. Say you're an Israeli student and everywhere you go on campus you feel like you're being painted as an evil occupier, and while you believe you *can* defend your country, it grows more and more emotionally exhausting to constantly feel like a core aspect of your identity is seen as illegitimate by everyone around you. Then a safe space would be saying that at the Jewish Society social, people shouldn't say ""ey how about that occupation then?"" It doesn't mean that it can never be discussed on campus, or that the topic is beyond the pale, it's a recognition that people benefit from being able to switch off and feel that the legitimacy of their identity is temporarily guaranteed. It's basically a codification for there being ""a time and a place"" to bring up issues which impact people's core identities; it's basically about having good manners."

A congressional subpoena has to serve a valid legislative purpose and if he's not going to answer questions then what is the purpose? That seems a little weak to me. This is obviously a partisan witch hunt, but it's still a congressional subpoena and you need to show up and state that you're exercising your fifth amendment rights. They're saying that he already did that in front of the House Benghazi Committee, but this is a separate committee so it seems like he should do it again. Anyway, nothing will come of this. He's not going to answer their questions because the Constitution says he doesn't have to. End of story. Chaffetz will grandstand as much as he can get away with and that will be the end of it.

If not voted on the new president could choose to let that nominee stand or nominate a new justice.

If we're going by popular vote, no presidential candidate has had anything even close to a mandate since Reagan won re-election with 58% in 1984. And no sane linguist would refer to 58% as a ""mandate."" It's a modest improvement over ""half."" Trump has 46.3% -- that's certainly not a mandate, it's not even a majority. Then again, neither is Clinton's 48.2%. And for people citing Obama in 2008, he only had 52.9%, which once again is roughly half. Nowhere close to ""mandate"" status. Now if we're talking about electoral college votes (which we should, since that's what the candidates actually focus on trying to win), Obama won 68% in 2008, which is much closer to ""mandate"" territory. To get significantly higher than that, you have to go back to George H. W. Bush's 1988 win with 79% of the electoral college. Meanwhile, Reagan won 90% of the electoral college in 1980 and won a record-setting 97.58% of the electoral college votes in 1984 (yes, you read that right). So let's all shut up about ""mandates"" please."

Trumps election is a disaster because the Republicans can pick Supreme Court Justices. They can push their conservative agenda. However to the latter point, just because people voted for Trump, doesn't mean they agree with the conservative party. Let's face it, people wanted to tear down the system. If Trump doesn't drain the swamp, if the people sense that Trump is just a puppet or at best indifferent to his job, he's out in 4 years easy. But more importantly, lets focus on mid term elections. The democrats have to paint Trump as a figurehead. someone who isn't the wildcard, bull in a china shop, swamp draining monster that the angry populist uprising wanted. If the democrats can make people believe policy is coming from up high on Conservative Establishment mountain, then the swamp draining will be getting rid of republicans in the senate, state govs, and congress.

It seems unlikely that Clinton and Trump will receive less than 40% of the vote each, despite both of them being historically disliked candidates. I've seen many people claim that if Romney said the things Trump does or Obama doing the things Clinton has done, they would both tank in support. But is this really true? Is this election really that unique that the candidates get away with being unfavorable or would the American people simply not care what their candidate says or does and still vote with their party? The last time a major party nominee received less than 40% of the vote was in 1992 for H.W. Bush, but this was only due to Ross Perot taking 19% and Bill Clinton only taking slightly more than 40%. The last time before that was in 1972. Even Walter Mondale received over 40% of the vote despite only winning one state. Is it almost impossible for a major party nominee to go way below 40% vote share in the future, since it is unlikely that candidates as disliked as the current ones will run for president any time soon?"

She is not acknowledging at all that the working middle class abandoned the Democrats this election in massive numbers. I mean, these people voted for Obama the last 2 times, and Trump this time. Why did they go for Trump? Is Elizabeth addressing reconnecting her party to the working class? No, all I hear is ""We won the popular vote!"" Yes, and you can thank the Southern California regions, particularly LA county where Hillary dominated in a landslide (There's like 15 million people in this area). However, she is not addressing the rest of the states, where if you remove California, but actually, not even California, just the massively dense population of Los Angeles and the surrounding area, Trump won 49 states by 2.2 million votes. I am not saying the LA votes don't count, don't get me wrong. My point is though that her dwelling on this popular vote thing is going to change nothing. Ya, Southern California might agree with you, but holy crap, look at Michigan. Obama won that by like 10% 4 years ago. He won Wisconsin by 8%. He won places like Iowa by around 10% in 2008 and 7% in 2012. Trump won Iowa with 9% more. Think about that for a second... 4 years ago compared to now, there was a 16% swing from Democrat to Republican. But no, all Warren can talk about is, ""But we won the popular vote thanks to Southern California!"" Honestly, I lost respect for Warren when I realized she was just another opportunist politician that likes to say stuff people want to hear, but at the end of the day, has no true conviction. Look at the primary. She has videos condemning Hillary as a corrupt ""pay for play"" person. She has videos on youtube describing how Hillary changed her vote on the bankruptcy regulations after getting campaign donations from big wallstreet donors. Yet, when word got rumored Hillary might be considering her for VP, after she already chose not to endorse Bernie, she 180'd and couldn't stop talking about how wonderful Hillary was and how fantastic she was. How Hillary was *beyond rapport.* Now, the campaign is over, and no longer is she the outsider challenging her own party, but she has become a full-fledged, card-carrying member of the establishment. She is now, imo, part of the problem with the Democrats where she can't even see past their own failures to connect with the American people. There is a reason why the Democrats lost what used to be unquestionably BLUE states... Did she address that at all? NOPE. It's not like the electoral college is going to change. It's part of the constitution and requires a constitutional amendment, and since the Republicans have the Presidency, the Senate, and the House, it is not going to happen. Democrats just need to accept this reality and figure out how to deal with it. Time to move on."

And other then in the US for example this government Organisation is allowed to bargain for rebates from the Pharma companies. And 8 million insured patients in a first world country is a pretty big slice of money - so they do bargain. Let's say there are two cancer drugs on the market for the same type of cancer (happens more often then you think) So negotiations are started with both companies - both companies show that their drugs are effective and Within a range of mortality (so one drug is equally good as the other - or if one is not as good it has other bonuses - like less side effects) Then negotiations start - and one comapny (the one with the better offer) gets the deal - it's now the ""go to"" drug for this specific type of cancer. If a doctors say though ""I am sure that drug B is better for this very specific patient"" he can get the other drug too - there is just one more step of approval needed - which goes pretty fast normally - can be done within minutes to hours - so you are not cut of from the other drug - the cheaper one is just preferred. And that is basically the whole trick - we are allowed to negotiate drug prices. Plus - there is less overhead here - no advertising for prescription drugs. Honestly I can't remember when I saw a tv spot for aspirin either - so maybe this was cancelled too. Less Pharma reps going to doctors peddling their stuff cause they cannot choose (except in special circumstances) what drugs they use. Large reliance on generics - if there is a generic available he pharamacy has to give it to you first - even if the doctor writes down the brand product - and so on. And that all leads to a health care system that is a lot cheaper and still gets everybody the care they need."

1,Why focus on actual issues when we can call someone a sexist?,ghostfox1_gfaqs,politics,-1,-1,-1,2016-10,12/10/2016 16:20,"You make some good points. And I totally agree that the 18yo scenario that you proposed sounds creepy, immature, and ""rapey"". Most of the comments that have gotten under my skin are when I see people saying that ""Trump brags about grabbing women by the pussy"". I think I might be guilty of associating that misleading statement with more valid complaints about what he said. I ended up listening to the clip again based on what you're saying and 100% don't like the way he talks about women in the clip. Here's what I ""hear"" in the tape when I listen: He told Bush that he failed when he tried to make a move on a married woman (cheating, yuk). He took her furniture shopping and didn't end up woo-ing her. Made some derogatory comments about her that are gross. He sees an attractive woman and eats some tic tacs, I presume because he doesn't want her to have a negative impression of his breath smelling and makes a joke about ""In case I kiss her"". Automatically attracted to beautiful women - guy talk. ""I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet.Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it."" This is the worst part I think. I think it's fair to assume he means ""I don't even wait [for permission?]"" but he doesn't actually say that, he could mean he doesn't wait to get home or to be in private. He also says that they ""let you do it [kiss them?]"" He's not saying he forces it if/when someone says no. In fact, he opened this tape up with saying how he ""failed"" to move in on the married woman. Then the next section is the ""You can do anything, [BUSH: Whatever you want?] Grab them by the pussy [BUSH:Laugh]. You can do anything."". Hyperbole, crude, inappropriate joke used to emphasize his point that as a star women let you do anything. Next, a few cat calls - pervy but guy talk. He then gets off the bus and *doesn't* automatically start kissing the attractive woman. Bush awkwardly proposes a hug for Donald and they hug/he kisses her on the cheek -- a ""family feud"" style interaction. The bottom line is that I don't approve of that conduct and it's not something I'd like to hear out of a 59 year old man let alone a presidential nominee. However, I think it's also really damaging to people's/the media's credibility to spin or exaggerate things at a time where the public trust of the media is already really damaged. I just wish that the media and Reddit would focus more on spreading information and letting people form their own opinions instead of twisting things and shaping perceptions. Well I am starting to regret posting my thoughts as it seems most people would rather not see them judging by the downvotes...but thanks for taking the time to make a good counter arguement."

The Podesta releases began three hours after video of Trump boasting about sexual assault surfaced. The checks and balance system remains intact but it was not designed to prevent foreign influence in our elections. One aspect of our election system, designed to prevent a demagogue from gaining the Presidency perhaps didn't work as founding fathers intended. However, the electoral college was also designed to prevent a candidate who was the popular vote from gaining the Presidency if they are unfit for the office."

In 2008 conservatives were screaming that Obama would ban guns and some were screaming he'd institute martial law. And yet we're still here. The point of a protest vote or voting 3rd party is to tell a party that they have lost you as a voter. These votes are one of the few checks we have to keep these parties in check anymore. I personally couldnt bring myself to vote for Obama or Romney in 2012. Obama had lost me after I was a rabid fan of him in 2008. Didn't deliver on the hope and change he promised. Romney, well, let's just say milquetoast Republicans aren't exactly inspiring. So, being happy with neither of them I voted for Mickey Mouse and despite being told by both Obama and Romney voters not voting for one or the other was a threat to our future, life went on pretty much the same as it ever had. If you don't want to give someone your vote, then don't do it. One thing I will never tell someone to do is tell them they have to vote for a particular candidate.

This is a huge issue that's not going to go away on its own, especially now that Republicans control congress and most state legislatures. I live in Washington State. We have committed to mail in/drop box voting across the state. All registered voters automatically have ballots mailed to their homes a few weeks before election day. We are able to take our time filling out our ballots, and once we've decided on all candidates and initiatives we can either mail ballots in, or drop them off at drop boxes that are accessible 24/7. Essentially I never have to wait in line or show my ID to anyone throughout the entire process. When I hear about states that only allow people to vote on election day it makes me furious. I can't understand how it's okay to make people in some states stand in line for up to 4 hours while I don't have to be inconvenienced in any way. We are voting in the same presidential election, so why should it be easier for me than for you?! Is this not a violation of people's rights when we are unnecessarily obstructing their ability to vote? We know mail-in early voting is a seamless, functional way to conduct elections, so why can't it be the standard across the country? I'm not a constitutional scholar or lawyer, but in my opinion voter suppression seems like a violation of the 14th amendment.
