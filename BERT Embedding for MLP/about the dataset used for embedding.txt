this labelled dataset is taken from Kaggle: Sarcastic Comments - REDDIT
for the BERT embedding process
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sherinclaudia/sarcastic-comments-on-reddit?resource=download
we used this to perform embedding since the sarcasm label is balanced and it is very big
our self-labelled datasets are skewed towards non-sarcastic
DISCLAIMER there may be NSFW subreddit topics inside the dataset!

when downloaded, it will be in a zip called 'archive'
extracting it reveals an excel file called 'train-balanced-sarcasm'
we did not include it as the file is very large (>100mb) but can be downloaded from the Kaggle site

when filtered to only comments with 'politic' topic = 40000+ comments (politics-only-topic)

the -2000, -5000 in the other csv files are the number of comments sampled from the original dataset.
