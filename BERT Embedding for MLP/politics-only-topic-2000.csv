I don't know if the President can change that. -Comparative studies among developed countries that show the police killing rate reformers believe the US should aspire to...afaik these countries all have significant structural differences from the US (less untreated mental illness and less driving per capita as well as more provisions to keep guns and even knives out of the hands of troubled individuals). It might be possible that most US police killings are necessary and would occur in France or Canada under the same circumstances; it's just that those circumstances don't happen there as much as there's less driving, meaning less traffic stops and less concern about unarmed suspects squishing cops with 2 tons machinery, as well as better healthcare and better background checks for guns."

Consider this: Trump has a political incentive to adopt a firm protectionist stance, but he also has enough of an ego that he wants to be able to point to the country and say ""No-one is better at the presidency than me"", and the impact to trade and the economy from strong protectionism threatens that. Enter the UK. He's already said he wants to put us first in line for a trade deal post-Brexit, so all we have to do is position ourselves as the gateway to the US economy. He can put in all the protections he wants, but by assuring our access, and allowing rules to be put in place that funnel goods and services through our economy to theirs (for a reasonable fee) he gives a route for companies in China etc to still trade on decent terms whilst maintaining the *appearance* of strong protectionism. It also gives him political insulation from not being strong on China, because he can just make it ""our fault"" that their effective rates are only slightly higher than they used to be, and he can defend not doing anything about it because after all, we are our own country and the special relationship is special and look at all the jobs he's creating. The numbers are increasing bigly! This then also helps with Brexit, because we can then leverage that position in our negotiations. Germany starts getting ideas about tariffs on goods? Oh look, President Trump just made an announcement outlining proposed new funding for the opening of markets in the UK for struggling American car manufacturers. France gets out of line? Oh look, President Trump has made an announcement outlining funding for increased export capacity for Californian wine producers to break into the European distribution market through ""our close partners in Britain"". I'm using idealised examples, but you get the idea. By playing the fears of the EU industrial markets against the political desires of the new President, we can manipulate the situation to our advantage. What makes it better is that if we do it right, we don't even have to hide what we're doing, because our counterparts in the EU will be powerless to stop us without ruining themselves politically. Is it cynically opportunistic? Tremendously! Is it evil? A little (hey for us that's progress!). It could work though..."

When you choose to be a civil servant, you don't represent yourself. You represent the people. It's their will, and their law, that you are enforcing. You do not elect yourself to special ""morality dispenser"" when you put yourself in her role. By NOT doing her job, she is actively harming the constituents that pay her salary. She is refusing to work, still getting paid, and enforcing her own morality on people who don't care what she thinks. Now let's jump over to our dancing friends. They don't want to perform, which harms no one. They would not be paid for the event, and they aren't enforcing their own will on anyone else. To the contrary, they simply do not want to be forced to show support of an individual that represents the opposites of their values. See how your comparison pretty much falls apart there, or are you still clinging to the idea that Kim Davis refusing to certify legal marriages is the same as these ladies refusing to dance? On a last note, I will say that the problem with the Kim Davis situation is that she was the only one who could legally certify the marriage licenses. No one in the office could do it and have it be legally binding. If there was an alternative to her signing them, then yes, I would say she would have been fully in the right to refuse the certification. But she can't use her political beliefs to fully block the marriages of legal couples that she doesn't agree with. Imagine if the Rockettes, for example, didn't just refuse to perform, but made it so NOT ONE ELSE could perform either. They said that because THEY didn't want to do it, no one else could either. Oh, and they got paid. That would be a better comparison."
